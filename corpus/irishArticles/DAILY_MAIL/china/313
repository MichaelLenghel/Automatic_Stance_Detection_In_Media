Reviews of a hole in a wall near a bank have been suspended by Tripadvisor after it was ranked the best thing to do in Ilkeston. The so-called “NatWest hole”, on Bath Street in the Derbyshire town, has been receiving reviews on the site since December 2018. But it has exploded in popularity over the last few days thanks to a slew of spoof write-ups. But administrators have put a stop to the fun, placing a temporary bar on reviews of the hole. A message on the hole’s Tripadvisor page reads: “Due to a recent event that has attracted media attention and has caused an influx of review submissions that do not describe a first-hand experience, we have temporarily suspended publishing new reviews for this listing. “If you’ve had a firsthand experience at this property, please check back soon – we’re looking forward to receiving your review!” The hole in the wall sits next to a cash machine and was reportedly installed as a safety feature to ensure customers could be aware of their surroundings as they withdraw money. Reviews have flooded in for the hole, with one user describing it as “an absolute paradigm of British architecture” and another comparing it with the “majestic wonder of Stonehenge or even the Pyramids”. One reviewer wrote: “I’ve seen the Great Wall of China, I’ve seen the Eiffel Tower, I’ve been to the Grand Canyon, but the NatWest hole has to be the most awe inspiring structure I have ever seen!” With 62 reviews, 55 of which awarded the site a maximum five stars, the hole is now ranked the best thing to do in Ilkeston, ahead of attractions including the Erewash Museum and Bennerley Viaduct.
