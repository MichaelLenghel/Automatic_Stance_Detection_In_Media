HONG KONG, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Hong Kong has further extended the suspension of schools until at least April 20 to contain the spread of the coronavirus, authorities in the Asian financial hub said on Tuesday as cases of the disease surged outside China. The city's Secretary for Education Kevin Yeung said classes would be suspended until after the Easter holiday with April 20 being the earliest date to return. Students had previously been due to return to lessons on March 16. (Reporting by Donny Kwok, Twinnie Siu and Jessie Pang; writing by Farah Master; editing by Christian Schmollinger)
