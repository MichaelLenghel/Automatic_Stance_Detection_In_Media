LONDON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Primark owner Associated British Foods warned on Monday there was a risk of supply shortages on some lines later in the 2019-20 financial year if delays in factory production in China are prolonged due to coronavirus. AB Foods, which sources a broad assortment of its product from China, said it typically builds inventories in advance of Chinese New Year and, as a consequence, is well stocked with cover for several months and does not expect any short term impact. The group, which also owns major sugar, grocery and agriculture arms, forecast first-half sales growth and operating profit ahead of the previous year.
