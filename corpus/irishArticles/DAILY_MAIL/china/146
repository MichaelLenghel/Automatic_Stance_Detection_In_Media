PARIS, Feb 25 (Reuters) - French fashion group SMCP , whose brands include Sandro and Maje, said on Tuesday its profits and sales in China would be hit by the coronavirus afflicting the region. "Since SMCP´s last communication on January 29, 2020, the outbreak of Covid-19 in China is having a material negative effect on Chinese consumption," the company said. "In this context, SMCP´s sales and profitability are significantly impacted in China (a key market for the group), and, to a lesser extent in the other regions, due to a decrease in Chinese tourists," it added in a statement.
