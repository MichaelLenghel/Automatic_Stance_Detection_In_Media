LYON, France (AP) - French club Lyon says its sold-out Champions League home game against Juventus will go ahead as planned on Wednesday despite the coronavirus outbreak in nearby Italy. Lyon said in a statement on Tuesday it received the go-ahead from French authorities for the match to take place "in its initial configuration." Up to 3,000 Juventus fans coming from different regions of Italy are expected to attend Groupama Stadium for the last-16, first-leg match. The fast-spreading virus from China has led to the postponement of Serie A games in northern Italy, where a cluster of the COVID-19 disease has caused seven deaths and towns to be locked down. Health Minister Olivier Veran told RTL radio on Tuesday that France is not considering closing its border with Italy, nor banning big gatherings of people because it would not make sense. Asked specifically about the Lyon-Juventus match, Veran said: "Should we ban gatherings? Should we stop the (Paris) Fashion Week? Should we stop matches? Should we close universities? The answer is no." ___ More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
