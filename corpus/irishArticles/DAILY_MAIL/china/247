Team GB have played down any concerns about coronavirus impacting the Tokyo Olympics, insisting they are preparing their athletes as normal for this summer's Games. The outbreak of the disease has caused some qualification events to be rescheduled and moved away from China.  A test event for the Paralympic sport of boccia in Tokyo later this week has also been limited to only Japanese athletes. But speaking with five months to go until the Olympics, Paul Ford, Team GB's deputy chef de mission, said: 'Everything we're hearing is that the Games are absolutely on track and will happen in the summer. 'We're following the situation, working closely with all the appropriate authorities. The welfare of our delegation is our priority. We're just focusing on what we can do and influence and that's the preparation of the athletes. 'We are reassured that it is being absolutely taken to the highest level inside Japanese government, IOC and World Health authorities to ensure what is right and appropriate for everyone, and that's out of our jurisdiction and control. What we can control is getting our athletes there in the best health and wellbeing possible.'
