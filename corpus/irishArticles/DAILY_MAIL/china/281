LONDON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - The Bank of England's chief economist Andy Haldane said on Monday he did not think the trade war between the United States and China meant globalisation had come to an end. Speaking to an audience in central London, Haldane said: "I´m not yet at the point of calling peak globalisation". Despite higher tariffs between the United States and China, cross-border flows of capital, ideas and people remained strong, he said. (Reporting by David Milliken, Editing by Kylie MacLellan)
