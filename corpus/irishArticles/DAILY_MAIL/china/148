Feb 25 (Reuters) - Industrial materials maker Morgan Advanced Materials has closed its manufacturing facilities in China because of the coronavirus outbreak and expects a hit to 2020 revenue and headline operating profit as a result, the company said on Tuesday. The British company, which generates around 10% of its revenue from China, said the outbreak will take around 3.5 million pounds ($4.5 million) off its headline operating profit and about 7 million pounds off its revenue in 2020.
