BEIJING, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Beijing on Monday warned its citizens against travelling to the United States, saying that Chinese tourists have been treated unfairly in the country due to excessive prevention measures over the coronavirus outbreak. The statement from China's tourism ministry also cited the U.S. "security situation" in its warning. China has repeatedly blamed the United States for what it considers to be an excessive reaction to the outbreak, including early curbs on visitors from China.
