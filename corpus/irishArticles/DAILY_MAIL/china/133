Feb 25 (Reuters) - European shares bounced back on Tuesday after recording their worst losses since June 2016 in the previous session, with investors assessing the economic hit of a coronavirus outbreak that has spread far beyond China. Markets across the globe attempted to stabilise, with the pan-European STOXX 600 index rising 0.6%. After a 5.4% tumble on Monday, Milan-listed shares rose 0.6%. Italy is struggling with the worst flare-up of coronavirus cases in Europe, with 220 cases reported and seven dead. Airline stocks, which took the biggest hit on Monday, edged higher. Lufthansa, EasyJet and Ryanair rose between 0.6% and 1.4%. Prudential Plc rose 2.9% after hedge fund Third Point LLC amassed a more than $2 billion stake and called on the British insurer to split into two companies.
