At first glance, this black and white collie looks like any other sheepdog. But Megan has become canine royalty – after selling for a world record £18,900 at auction. The two-and-a-half-year-old fetched the huge sum because she comes from a family of champions. Now owner Emma Gray is not letting Megan out of her sight until she is collected by the buyer. The shepherdess, 33, who lives on a 100-acre farm near Otterburn, Northumberland, said: ‘I should wrap her up in cotton wool after she sold for that. You hope for a good fee but it was still a surprise.  'She’s been bought by a farmer in Oklahoma who has a herd of wagyu cattle. It’s my life to breed sheepdogs but it’s not easy to see them go. After the auction she slept on the pillow by me; I didn’t want her out of my sight, she’s a very valuable girl.’  Similar farm dogs usually sell for around £2,000. But Megan’s father Roy was a two-time international sheepdog champion and her mother is the sister of another champ. She sold at Skipton Auction Mart, North Yorkshire, for 18,000 guineas, an old currency still traditionally used in some livestock bidding. Mrs Gray set the previous record of £14,700 for sheepdog bitch Brenna a year ago. The world’s most expensive dog is a Tibetan mastiff, sold for £772,000 in China in 2014.
