WASHINGTON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Commerce on Monday said it had determined that wooden cabinets and vanities imported from China have been sold at less than fair market value in the United States. The International Trade Commission is scheduled to make its final injury determination on whether U.S. manufacturers have been harmed by the imported Chinese wooden products by April 6, the department said in a statement. U.S. officials launched their subsidy and dumping investigations at the request of the American Kitchen Cabinet Alliance. (Reporting by Susan Heavey, Editing by Franklin Paul)
