Feb 24 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks futures slumped on Monday as a surge in coronavirus cases outside China fanned fears of a bigger hit to global economic growth, driving investors to safe-haven assets. Gold soared to a seven-year high, while oil tumbled nearly 4% as fears of a pandemic grew after Iran, Italy and South Korea reported a rise in virus cases.
