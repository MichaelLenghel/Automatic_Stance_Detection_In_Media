New Jersey Devils forward Brian Boyle, Florida Panthers goalie Roberto Luongo and Carolina Hurricanes center Jordan Staal were named as the three finalists for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy, the NHL announced Saturday. The award goes to "the player who best exemplifies the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey." The winner will be announced during the NHL Awards show in Las Vegas on June 20. Boyle, 33, was diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia, a bone marrow cancer, during training camp and was back in the lineup by Nov. 1. He scored 10 goals in his first 25 games, made the All-Star Game for the first time in his career, and finished the season with 23 points (13 goals, 10 assists) in 69 games. Luongo, 39, dealt with hand and groin injuries that caused him to miss more than two months and then went 9-3-1 with a 2.44 goals-against average in his first 13 games back in the net to finish 18-11-2 with a 2.47 GAA in 35 games. The resident of Parkland, Fla., delivered a powerful pregame speech at the Panthers' first home game after 17 people were killed in a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High on Feb. 14. Staal, 29, totaled 46 points (19 goals, 27 assists) in 79 games, the second-highest goals and points totals of his six seasons with the Hurricanes. In late February, his wife Heather delivered a stillborn daughter named Hannah who was born with a terminal birth defect. The trophy is named after former Minnesota North Stars player Bill Masterton, who in 1968 became the only NHL player to die from injuries suffered during a game. --Field Level Media
