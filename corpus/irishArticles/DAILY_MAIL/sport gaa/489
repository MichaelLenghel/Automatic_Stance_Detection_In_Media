Aurelio De Laurentiis, chairman of Napoli, has admitted that Napoli will soon be forced to listen to offers for defender Kalidou Koulibaly, according to Sky Sport Italia (via The Mirror). Manchester United are still after Koulibaly's services, despite having an £82million offer rejected during the summer transfer window.   'I loved Koulibaly the man so I refused €105m, but a time will come when I'll have to sell him. Whoever says we didn't improve our defence is wrong,' said De Laurentiis. Manchester United splashed £80million on Harry Maguire over the summer, but they're still interested in finding a partner for him in the heart of defence.  Koulibaly has become one of the most formidable centre backs in world football since joining Napoli from Genk back in 2014.  There is pressure mounting on United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer after their worst start to a league season for 30 years, so bringing in a new player to solidify their defence could be on the horizon. Meanwhile, Napoli are fourth in Serie A, but Jose Callejon and Dries Mertens are reportedly also heading out the door sooner rather than later. De Laurentiis warned his players that if they are to leave, not to 'sell out' and go to China.   'If they want to sell themselves out in China, overpaid to live a life of s*** for two or three years, it's their problem,' he said. 'I can't consider China to be competitive. China's far away. If they consider it to be close, it's their problem. 'In life, you have to choose whether to be happy and find a job you enjoy doing or work just for money. For me, money is a means and not an end; if it's an end for them then they should go to China.'
