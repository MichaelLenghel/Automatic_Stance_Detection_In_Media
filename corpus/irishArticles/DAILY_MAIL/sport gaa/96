Dallas Stars goaltender Ben Bishop was placed on injured reserve with an upper-body injury after being unable to practice on Friday. The move was made retroactive to Feb. 4. Bishop was unable to play Thursday in the Stars' 3-2 overtime loss to the Nashville Predators, and the club put him on the IR when it became clear he wouldn't be able to play on Saturday against the Arizona Coyotes. The Stars are hoping Bishop will be healthy to return for their Tuesday road game against the Florida Panthers. "He's not ready, so we're going to put him on IR, and he should be ready by Tuesday," Stars coach Jim Montgomery told reporters on Friday. "We just don't want to take a chance, and it's not fair to him to back up and not feel 100 percent." Montgomery said that Anton Khudobin would start in goal on Saturday. The backup will be Landon Bow, who was recalled earlier this week from the Texas Stars of the American Hockey League. Bishop, 32, is 19-12-2 with a 2.30 goals-against average and a .924 save percentage in 34 games (33 starts) this season. He last played in a 5-4 win over the Coyotes on Monday, when he saved 38 of 42 shots. Khudobin, also 32, is 9-9-3 with a 2.42 GAA and a .924 save percentage in 23 games (21 starts). --Field Level Media
