Chelsea can expect a verdict within three weeks after putting in their appeal to overturn a FIFA transfer ban for breaking youth transfer rules. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) said after a hearing was held on Wednesday that their ruling into overturning the transfer ban can be expected in the first half of December. The transfer window opens on January 1, meaning Chelsea would be able to buy players again within a few weeks if their appeal is successful.  Chelsea have already served half of their one-year ban on registering new players during the summer window. The Stamford Bridge club are challenging verdicts by FIFA's disciplinary and appeal committees that the Blues had 150 violations of rules protecting minors from trafficking. Those cases involved about 70 players. Chelsea also broke rules prohibiting third-party influence on players. FIFA imposed a fine of 600,000 Swiss francs (£467,000). The club has denied wrongdoing. The timeline of this transfer of minors' case is similar to Barcelona's appeal in 2014 when CAS upheld a transfer ban on December 30, almost four weeks after a hearing.
