Match-fixing in sport. It is a subject that makes fans boil with anger and ask: just how and why would any professional do it? Aren't they already paid enough for a job many of us would love to do? In the This is Moneyball season 3 opener, assistant editor Lee Boyce and broadcaster Georgie Frost tackle this tricky subject and are joined by someone who was swept up in the madness. Centre-back Moses Swaibu – a former Crystal Palace youth player – became one of the first names on the team sheet for Lincoln City in the late-2000s. However, he became embroiled in match-fixing as he slipped down to semi-professional level. For the first time, Moses candidly tells his story, how it unfolded, his regret and why a stint in jail helped him realise that he needed to make sure young players aren't tempted to make the same mistakes.  We publish the This is Moneyball podcast to the player on This is Money, above every Tuesday.
