Chelsea's appeal against a transfer ban by FIFA for breaking rules to sign youth players from abroad will be heard on November 20 at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. CAS announced the hearing date on Monday, with a verdict due before the January transfer window opens. Chelsea have already served half of its one-year ban on registering new players and given the club did not seek to freeze the FIFA sanction, they have been preparing the appeal to CAS. FIFA's disciplinary and appeal committees have said Chelsea violated 150 rules protecting minors from trafficking. Those cases involved about 70 players. Chelsea was also judged to have broken rules prohibiting third-party influence on players. FIFA imposed a fine of 600,000 Swiss francs (£470,000). The club has denied wrongdoing. A report published last week by FIFA into the club's failed appeal against their suspension confirmed that they were found guilty of 150 rule breaches, of which 27 were punishable, involving 71 players.  One breach saw one player, from the age of 13, play 75 games for the club over a two-and-a-half year period despite only being registered as a trialist over three six-week periods.  Burkina Faso attacker Bertrand Traore — who moved to London from his homeland — played for the club for three years before being registered in 2014.  The FIFA panel ruled: 'The committee has no doubt the matches referred to were organised under the auspices of the FA. The players moved to England, joined Chelsea FC and played organised football.'
