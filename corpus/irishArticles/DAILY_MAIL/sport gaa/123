The Pittsburgh Penguins placed goaltender Matt Murray on injured reserve because of a lower-body injury, the team announced Thursday. The two-time Stanley Cup-winning goalie Murray, 24, has struggled through the worst season of his four-year NHL career, sporting a 4-5-1 record, .877 save percentage and 4.08 goals-against average. In his first three seasons, Murray was 68-28-8 and had never sported a save percentage below .907 or GAA higher than 3.00. "This is something that he's been dealing with for a couple of weeks," Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said via the team's Twitter account. "The decision was made this morning to rest and see if that gives him an opportunity to heal." The Penguins plan to call up goaltender Tristan Jarry on an emergency basis from their AHL affiliate in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton later on Saturday, according to executive vice president and general manager Jim Rutherford. The 23-year-old Jarry played 26 games last season in Pittsburgh as well as one game the previous season, owning a 14-7-2 career mark with a 2.78 GAA and .907 save percentage in 27 games (24 starts). His 14 victories last season for the Penguins were tops in the league among rookies. Jarry, who has a 4-5-2 record, 2.89 GAA and .909 save percentage this season in the AHL, became the first goalie in the minor league's history to score an empty-net goal from his own end in a game against Springfield last week. The Penguins next play in Boston against the Bruins on Friday. --Field Level Media
