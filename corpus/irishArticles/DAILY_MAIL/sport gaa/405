Cycling Australia has rolled out the big guns as it tries to achieve an ambitious and controversial overhaul of how the sport is run. Robbie McEwen, Anna Meares, Simon Gerrans, Phil Anderson and Caroline Buchanan headline 45 Australian cycling figures who have signed an open letter, calling for the AusCycling reform proposal to be backed. Voting is underway for the proposal, which would have the separate Cycling Australia, Mountain Bike Australia and BMX Australia finally merge into one organisation. But it has had plenty of blowback and late last month there was a report that NSW road and track clubs had voted against the initiative. AusCycling advocates went around the country in September to spruik the proposal's benefits, but there has also been vocal criticism in WA. The proposal effectively needs 75 per cent voting support across the three separate bodies to be adopted. "We ... believe the AusCycling proposal jointly developed by BMX Australia, Mountain Bike Australia and Cycling Australia is the best model for the future growth of Australian cycling and will deliver ongoing benefits for riders of all disciplines, preferences and bikes," the letter reads. "Australian cyclists ... have been crying out for years for all forms of cycling to unite to form one strong, effective and inclusive organisation for the benefit of all. "We believe AusCycling is the right vehicle to give cycling the voice it deserves." Prominent mountain biker Troy Brosnan and Rio Olympics BMX rider Anthony Dean have also signed the open letter.
