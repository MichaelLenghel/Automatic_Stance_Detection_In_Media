ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) - Philipp Grubauer will start Game 1 of the playoffs for the Washington Capitals over Vezina Trophy-winning goaltender Braden Holtby. Grubauer started 10 of the final 16 games of the regular season since Holtby was given time off to reset himself, going 7-3-0 with a 2.32 goals-against average and .925 save percentage to earn the job. Holtby struggled with a 3.75 GAA and .886 save percentage in his final 17 appearances. The opener Thursday night against Columbus will be Grubauer's second career start in the Stanley Cup playoffs. Grubauer started a game against the New York Islanders in the first round in 2015 when Holtby was sick and has entered in relief once.
