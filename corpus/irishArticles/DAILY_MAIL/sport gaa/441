Oct 30 (Reuters) - Soccer accounted for 87% of 240 allegations of misconduct reported to the Sport Integrity (SI) Hotline over the last two years, highlighting "a significant number of match-fixing, internal corruption and sexual abuse issues". The SI Hotline, established by the International Centre for Sport Security (ICSS) in 2018, gives whistleblowers from every region a platform to submit integrity violations in sport and on Wednesday it released the first summary of reported cases. The SI summary shows match fixing and money laundering accounted for 35% of reported cases across all sports, while sexual abuse and doping related complaints made up 15% and internal corruption 10%. Other sports plagued by allegations of corruption and abuse included tennis, handball and athletics, with the majority of the complaints being registered from Africa and Europe. Once a case is registered on the SI platform, an integrity expert at the Sport Integrity Unit (SIU) analyses the information for authenticity. Following multiple content verification checks, the SIU can then choose to involve relevant authorities and enforcement agencies to complete the investigation.
