The New York Islanders reacquired left wing Matt Martin from the Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange for goaltender Eamon McAdam, both teams announced on Tuesday. Martin spent his first six-plus NHL seasons with the Islanders before playing the last two with Toronto. The 29-year-old had 12 points (three goals, nine assists) in 50 games for the Maple Leafs last season. Overall, he has 50 goals and 59 assists (109 points) in 570 career NHL games. Martin has two seasons remaining on a four-year, $10 million deal. McAdam, 23, split time at two minor league affiliates last season. He was 5-2-0 with a 2.77 goals-against average in nine appearances for the Bridgeport Sound Tigers of the American Hockey League, and 13-10-2 with a 2.84 GAA in 29 games for the Worcester Railers of the East Coast Hockey League. --Field Level Media
