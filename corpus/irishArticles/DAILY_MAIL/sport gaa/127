Dallas goalie Ben Bishop, injured Monday night, is expected to be out of the lineup for at least a week, Stars coach Jim Montgomery said Tuesday. Bishop has a lower-body injury, Montgomery said. The 10-year veteran, who is 8-5-1 with two shutouts this season, left Monday's game in New York against the Rangers after the second period with the game tied at 1-1. Backup goalie Anton Khudobin allowed one goal in the Stars' 2-1 loss. Khudobin, also in his 10th season, is 3-3-1 with a 2.37 GAA and .925 save percentage this season. He will be the starter in Bishop's absence, and several media outlets reported that the Stars are expected to bring up goalie Landon Bow of the American Hockey League's Texas Stars. Khudobin downplayed the extra work, saying he will go about his business as usual. "It's not easy, but that's the part of the job," Khudobin told NHL.com. "Not really that I'm planning that I am playing every day, but at the same time I have to prepare for it. Nothing changes." The Stars have three games left this week: at Pittsburgh on Wednesday, home against Ottawa on Friday and at Colorado on Saturday, a game that begins a four-game road trip that includes three stops in Canada. --Field Level Media
