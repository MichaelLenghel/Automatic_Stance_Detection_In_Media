Passionate cinephiles Leon Mackie and his wife, Lilly Lang, solved the problem by launching the Cardboard Box office project where they recreate famous scenes from their favorite films using packing materials for the entertainment of their son, Orson.  On their site, Cardboardboxoffice.com, the couple, who live in Australia, explained that they decided to turn their home into an amateur film studio after moving. You're gonna need a bigger baby: Leon Mackie (right) and his wife have launched the Cardboard Box Office project, recreating scenes from their favorite films, among them Jaws, with their son, Orson   Ready-made props: Leon Mackie and Lilly Lang recently moved their family to Sydney, Australia, for a job and were left with a lot of cardboard boxes   No child's play: The movie-obsessed family have not shied away from grown-up fare, including the horror classic Alien (left) and the action favorite Die Hard (right), with baby Orson in the starring role of John McClane    In October, Mackie, a book designer, transplanted his family from Melbourne to Sydney to take a job with a book publisher.  'With our social lives drastically altered we decided to find a way to make some of those housebound weekends a little more fun,' the couple wrote on their site. For the past month, Leon, Lilly and their 10-month-old son, Orson, have been busy building movie sets out of household items and re-enacting scenes from films like Apollo 13, The Dark Knight (in their version, The Dark Knighty-Night), Indiana Jones: The Temple of Doom (The Cradle of Doom), and many others.  The family so far have accumulated more than a dozen hilarious photos showcasing their unbridled creativity and acting chops, with amusing, child-friendly titles to boot. Castababy: In Leon and Lilly's version of Castaway, Wilson the ball is fashioned out of rolled up paper   The Dark Knighty-Night: Orson, who is six months old, here plays Batman staring at the bat signal in the darkened skies over Gotham   The Life Domestic: Orson has big shoes to fill as he tackles Bill Murray's role in his parents' remake of The Life Aquatic   Write caption hereWhat's in a name? The family always come up with alternative, baby-themed titles for their movie remakes, like The Good, The Bad and The Dribbly (left), and Goo-Goo Gaa-Gaa-rassic Park (right)    Their latest pre-Christmas offering posted this week on their site and labelled  Homemade Alone is inspired by the 1990 holiday classic Home Alone. In the photo, little Orson is shown booby-trapping a cooking pot as a pair of hapless house burglars, portrayed by his parents, are coming through the door.  Another image shows the toddler as Tom Hanks’ castaway on a raft in amid a stormy sea of teal-colored fabric, with only Wilson the ball (here made of rolled-up paper) to keep him company.  Last month, the aspiring filmmakers tackled the horror genre with a spin on the memorable scene from 'Alien,' in which a slimly extra-terrestrial embryo bursts from poor Kane’s chest.  Papa La Vista, Baby: Mackie and Lang built a tractor-trailer out of cardboard and furniture for this remake of Terminator 2: Judgement Day   The World's Smallest Indian: Even though The World's Fastest Indian came out more than six years before Orson's birth, he looks very convincing in the role of New Zealand racer Burt Munro in his cardboard speed bike   Genre classics: Indiana Jones: The Temple of Doom received the Cardboard Box Office treatment (left), with Mackie playing Indie himself, while in their version of Home Alone (right), Orson got the starring role of Kevin, while his parents were relegated to play the hapless burglars walking right into his trap    Out of this world: For their re-enactment of Apollo 13, Mackie and Lang build a rocket out of cardboard   In the new version, however, a sock puppet with plastic teeth stands in for the gooey critter perched on top of a terrified-looking Leon’s torso, and fake blood is fashioned out of red yard.  Since launching the home studio in November, Mackie, Lang and baby Orson have tackled such classics as Jurassic Park, called 'Goo-Goo Gaa-Gaa-rassic Park' in their version; Apollo 13, Die Hard and Star Wars, where the couple's toddler is armed with a light saber constructed out of a cardboard cylinder lit up with an LED light.   Earlier in the family's cinematic experiment, they have built an impressive-looking model of the Orca and a replica of a fearsome, toothy Great White from cardboard for a scene from Jaws.
