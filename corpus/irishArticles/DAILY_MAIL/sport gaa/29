The New York Rangers called up top goaltender prospect Igor Shesterkin on Monday, and he could make his NHL debut Tuesday night against the visiting Colorado Avalanche. The 24-year-old Russian was the Rangers' fourth-round draft pick in 2014 and played six seasons in the Kontinental Hockey League before coming to North America this season. In 23 games with the AHL's Hartford Wolf Pack, Shesterkin has a 15-4-3 record with a 1.93 goals-against average, a .932 save percentage and three shutouts. He was selected to play in the 2020 AHL All-Star Classic. Rangers goalie Henrik Lundqvist missed Saturday's game at Vancouver due to an illness. Alexandar Georgiev made the start and tallied 25 saves in a 2-1 loss to the Canucks. Shesterkin appeared in 117 KHL regular-season games over parts of six seasons from 2013-19, compiling an 80-19-15 record along with a 1.68 GAA, a .935 save percentage and 27 shutouts. --Field Level Media
