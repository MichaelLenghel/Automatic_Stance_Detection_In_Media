Boston Bruins goaltender Tuukka Rask was granted a leave of absence from the club, the team announced Friday. The Bruins said Rask left the team due to a "personal matter." Boston general manager Don Sweeney told reporters the leave of absence wasn't health related. He also asked for privacy on behalf of Rask. Rask, 31, is just 4-4-0 with a 3.05 goals-against average in eight appearances (seven starts) this season. He won more than 30 games in each of the previous five seasons with his GAA ranging from 2.04 in 2013-14 to 2.56 in 2015-16. Rask won the Vezina Trophy as the league's top goaltender in 2013-14 when he went 36-15-6 with seven shutouts. Overall, Rask is 242-141-53 with a 2.27 GAA and 41 shutouts in parts of 12 seasons with the Bruins. Jaroslav Halak will see most of the playing time between the pipes with Rask away. Halak is 4-1-2 with a 1.96 GAA in nine appearances (eight starts). --Field Level Media
