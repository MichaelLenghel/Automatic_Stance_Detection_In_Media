The Los Angeles Kings reacquired goalkeeper Peter Budaj from the Tampa Bay Lightning on Wednesday in exchange for forward Andy Andreoff. Budaj previously played parts of two seasons with the Kings. He played in just eight games for the Lightning last season when we went 3-3-1 with a 3.76 goals-against average. Andreoff had three goals and nine points in 45 games for the Kings last season. In four seasons with Los Angeles, the 27-year-old Andreoff had 24 points (13 goals, 11 assists) in 159 games. Budaj, 35, is 158-131-40 with a 2.69 GAA and 18 shutouts in 12 seasons with the Colorado Avalanche, Montreal Canadiens, Kings and Lightning. He went 28-20-3 with a 2.15 GAA in 54 games for the Kings in 2015-17. The Kings traded Budaj to the Lightning prior to the trading deadline in Feb. 2017 as part of the package that sent goalie Ben Bishop to Los Angeles. --Field Level Media
