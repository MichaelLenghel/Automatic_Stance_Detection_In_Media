Goaltender Cory Schneider is accompanying the New Jersey Devils on their seven-game road excursion and will make his season debut sometime during the trip, coach John Hynes told reporters. Schneider had offseason hip surgery and just completed a three-game conditioning stint for Binghamton of the American Hockey League. He pronounced himself ready to go on Monday. "It's more excitement and eagerness than nervousness," Schneider told reporters. "To compete again, at this level, it's fun. The way it ended last year in the playoffs, you have that feeling in your mind and that's the level you want to get to again." Schneider went 17-16-6 with a 2.93 goals-against average in 40 appearances last season. He missed time with hip and groin injuries and underwent hip surgery on May 1. Schneider is in his sixth season with the Devils after spending his first five with the Vancouver Canucks. Keith Kinkaid has started New Jersey's first eight games and will again get the call for Tuesday's road game against the Tampa Bay Lightning. Hynes liked what he saw of Schneider in Monday's workout. "It was the first time in a while he has had his own net in an NHL practice and it was 55 minutes of good work," Hynes said. "I think it's important we take it day by day with the goalies. Kinkaid will play Tuesday, but we do have a back-to-back situation coming up (Nov. 5-6 against the Pittsburgh Penguins and Ottawa Senators). "Cory for sure will get in, but I can't guarantee which game that will be." Kinkaid is 5-2-1 with a 2.12 GAA for the Devils. New Jersey sent goaltender Eddie Lack to Binghamton on a conditioning assignment in a corresponding move. --Field Level Media
