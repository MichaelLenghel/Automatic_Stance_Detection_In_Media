Pittsburgh goaltender Matt Murray returned to practice Tuesday, and he could start at Chicago on Wednesday after missing the Penguins' past 11 games with a lower-body injury. "It's still undecided," Murray told reporters of playing against the Blackhawks. "I still have to talk to the doctors and stuff like that. But the progression is there. So it's still undecided. ... It feels good (to practice). You kind of take it for granted how much fun it is to be out there with the team." Murray, who missed time earlier this season due to a concussion, has struggled when on the ice, posting a 4-5-1 record and a 4.08 goals-against average. His backup, Casey DeSmith, is 9-4-4 with a 2.34 GAA. Still, Penguins coach Mike Sullivan is looking forward to getting the two-time Stanley Cup-winning goalie back. "We'd like to get him involved as soon as we can," Sullivan said of Murray. "We're playing a lot of games here so we need two goalies to participate, to help us. And Matt's obviously an important part of this team, so we'd like to get him involved as soon as we can. When we know he's at his best, he's our No. 1 goalie." After traveling to Chicago on Wednesday, the Penguins return home to host the Boston Bruins on Friday and Los Angeles Kings on Saturday. The Anaheim Ducks then visit on Monday before Pittsburgh goes back to the road Dec. 19 at Washington. After a slow start, the Penguins are tied for third in the Metropolitan Division with 32 points. --Field Level Media
