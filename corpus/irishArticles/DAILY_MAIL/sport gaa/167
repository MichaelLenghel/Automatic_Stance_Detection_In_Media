The Dallas Stars made a move to spruce up their goaltending combination by signing veteran Anton Khudobin to a two-year, $5 million deal on Sunday during the opening day of the NHL free-agency period. The 32-year-old is expected to provide support for starting goalie Ben Bishop. Dallas also signed right wing Blake Comeau to a three-year, $7.2 million contract, right wing Valeri Nichushkin to a two-year, $5.9 million deal and defenseman Roman Polak to a one-year, $1.3 million pact. Landing Khudobin was a much-needed move in the eyes of Dallas general manager Jim Nill, who was looking for a solid goalkeeper who could spell Bishop and keep the starter fresh. "Anton is a proven NHL netminder that gives his team a chance to win every time he's on the ice," Nill said in a statement. "We look forward to him joining our club and making a positive impact for the next two seasons." Khudobin was 16-6-7 with a 2.56 goals-against average and .913 save percentage in 31 games (29 starts) for the Boston Bruins last season. He has a career mark of 67-51-16 with a 2.47 GAA and .915 save percentage in 147 NHL games (135 starts) in nine seasons with the Minnesota Wild, Carolina Hurricanes, Anaheim Ducks in addition to two stints with Boston. Comeau, 32, scored 34 points (13 goals, 21 assists) in 79 games for the Colorado Avalanche last season. Overall, he has 285 points (121 goals, 164 assists) in 12 seasons with the New York Islanders, Calgary Flames, Columbus Blue Jackets, Pittsburgh Penguins and Avalanche. "Blake will be a great addition to our forward group with his skill set and ability to play anywhere in the lineup", Nill said. "His elite speed makes him a disruptive defensive presence and he fits well with what (new) coach Jim Montgomery is trying to accomplish." Nichushkin, 23, returns to Dallas after playing the past two seasons for CSKA Moscow of the Kontinental Hockey League. He had 27 goals and 24 assists in 86 games for Moscow in that span. Prior to the stint, he played parts of three seasons for the Stars and had 23 goals and 41 assists (64 points) in 166 games. "Val was one of his team's most outstanding players last season," Nill said. "He is a fantastic addition to our depth at forward and we look forward to his return to our club." Polak, 32, had 12 points (two goals, 10 assists) in 54 games for the Toronto Maple Leafs last season. He also blocked 84 shots. In 12 NHL seasons, Polak has 127 points (25 goals, 102 assists) in 688 games with the St. Louis Blues, San Jose Sharks and Maple Leafs (two stints). "Roman is a tested, veteran defenseman who brings a physical element to our back-end," Nill said. "He is a respected competitor and will help round out our defensive group." Dallas also signed left wing Michael Mersch to a two-year, two-way contract and goaltender Colton Point to a three-year, entry-level deal. Mersch played in 17 games for the Los Angeles Kings during the 2015-16 season, scoring three points (one goal, two assists). He had 21 goals and 28 assists in 65 games for the Ontario Reign of the American Hockey League last season. Point, 20, played college hockey for Colgate last season and went 16-12-5 with a 1.74 GAA. --Field Level Media
