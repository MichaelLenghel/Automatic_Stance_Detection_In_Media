La Liga have agreed to stage a league match between Atletico Madrid and Villarreal in the United States, according to reports. The match would reportedly take place at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami  – a 65,000-seater venue that has hosted five Super Bowls - on December 8 . It comes less than a year after the Spanish top flight failed in hosting one of Barcelona's league fixtures in the US. Plans to host the game between the Catalan giants and Girona in Miami fell through after the controversial proposals were rejected while being met with uproar. However, according to AS, presidents of both Atletico and Villarreal have made the agreement to go ahead with the game as the Spanish league looks to promote the sport in North America.  'I hope this time comes to fruition, we are starting to see if Villarreal-Atleti can be played in Miami,' Villarreal president Fernando Roig confirmed in El Transistor. 'Atleti have agreed to play it in Miami, but for me I would like for this to have everyone's consensus.'  In August 2018, La Liga signed a 15-year agreement with entertainment company Relevant Sports designed to promote the sport and La Liga in North America back in August. The deal included hosting one regular season Spanish league game on American soil per season. One of the main elements that may scupper plans again is the travelling for fans from each club. Charter flights to Miami for supporters is being considered while Villarreal will be compensated for the loss of one home game with a bigger away allocation at the Wanda Metropolitano later in the season.
