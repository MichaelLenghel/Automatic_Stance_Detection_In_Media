Ron Hextall finally found the Philadelphia Flyers a veteran goaltender as the Flyers agreed on Tuesday to part with a conditional third-round pick in 2018 and another in 2019 to pry Petr Mrazek from the Detroit Red Wings. Hextall, general manager of the Flyers and a former NHL goalie, resisted making a move for a netminder but did so with his top two options injured. Starter Brian Elliott could miss the next five weeks with an abdominal injury and his primary backup for the Flyers, Michal Neuvirth, was injured on Sunday. This season, Mrazek, 26, is 8-7-2 with a 2.89 goals-against average and a .910 save percentage. He is 5-2-2 in his past 10 appearances with a 2.01 GAA. --The New York Rangers traded defenseman Nick Holden to the Boston Bruins for defenseman Rob O'Gara and a third-round pick in the 2018 NHL draft, the team announced.
