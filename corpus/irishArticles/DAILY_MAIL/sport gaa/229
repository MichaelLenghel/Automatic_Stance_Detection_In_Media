Philadelphia Flyers goaltender Brian Elliott will miss five to six weeks after undergoing core muscle surgery on Tuesday. Flyers general manager Ron Hextall confirmed the morning procedure prior to the club's game against the New Jersey Devils on Tuesday night. Elliott, 32, suffered the injury during Saturday's 4-3 shootout victory over the Arizona Coyotes. He departed the contest during the shootout. Michal Neuvirth will be the team's No. 1 goalie during Elliott's absence. Elliott is 21-11-7 with 2.72 goals-against average and .908 save percentage in 41 games. Over the past two-plus months, he has gone 15-5-1 with a 2.51 GAA and .912 save percentage. Neuvirth, 29, is 7-7-2 with a 2.50 GAA and .917 save percentage in 18 games this season. Alex Lyon is serving as the backup. Lyon was recalled on Sunday from Lehigh Valley of the American Hockey League. --Field Level Media
