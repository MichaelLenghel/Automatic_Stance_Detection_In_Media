A welcoming water cannon salute backfired spectacularly after Dubai firefighters broke the Saudi plane they were welcoming on the country's national day and injured a passenger.  Footage shows malfunctioning hoses from two fire engines pelt the side of the Saudi Airlines Airbus A320-214 before water is sent high into the air and comes crashing down.  The highly pressurised water hit the left side of the plane and forced an over-wing emergency exit hatch to open in the incident last September.  After the hatch had opened inward, a safety slide was automatically deployed.  This triggered a master alarm which alerted the flight crew to what was happening and allowed them to halt the plane.  The injured passenger, who had been sitting next to the hatch in a window seat, was given immediate medical attention and was able to carry on with their journey.  According to a statement from the United Arab Emirates' General Aviation Authority (GAA), reported by the the local Khaleej Times, there was a technical fault with one of the hoses.  A firefighter had tried to select a high pressure setting on the hose which would see the water arc in the style of a traditional salute but the hose didn't respond correctly.  Dubai International Airport said it has reviewed its procedure for water cannon salutes in the wake of the incident. It said: 'Immediately following the incident, and working with the vehicle manufacturer and regulatory authorities, Dubai Airports conducted a thorough inspection of its fleet of fire trucks and reviewed its water salute procedures to ensure the fault was not in evidence elsewhere and to prevent any future recurrence'.
