Chicago Blackhawks goaltender Corey Crawford has recovered from a concussion and was activated by the team on Monday. Crawford, 34, was sidelined more than two months after his second concussion in less than a year. Chicago removed Crawford from injured reserve and assigned goaltender Collin Delia to Rockford of the American Hockey League. Crawford was injured on Dec. 16 when his head hit the goalpost during a game against the San Jose Sharks. He was placed on the IR the following day, retroactive to Dec. 16. Last season, Crawford suffered a concussion on Dec. 23, 2017, and missed the rest of the season. The recovery period was lengthy for Crawford as he continued to battle symptoms throughout the rest of last season and through the summer. Crawford is 6-14-2 with a 3.28 goals-against average and .902 save percentage in 23 games this season. The two-time All-Star had one shutout to raise his career count to 24. Delia, 24, was 6-4-3 with a 3.48 GAA and .909 save percentage in 15 appearances. The Blackhawks visit the Anaheim Ducks on Wednesday. --Field Level Media
