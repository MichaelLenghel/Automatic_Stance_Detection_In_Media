Mike Smith saved the Calgary Flames on Sunday, at a cost to his health. The goalie stopped John Tavares' shot with 1.1 seconds left and the Flames ahead of the host New York Islanders 3-2, and he went down in pain. Smith sustained an apparent groin injury, the Calgary Sun reported, and he was helped off the ice by trainer Kent Kobelka. David Rittich replaced Smith for the faceoff and the final 1.1 seconds, and the Flames held on for the victory. Calgary coach Glen Gulutzan said of Smith's injury, "It's tough, you never want to see it (happen), but we'll deal with it when we know exactly what we're dealing with. It would be a huge blow for our team (if he were to miss a significant amount of time). Arguably, he's been our MVP. "But he's a guy that takes such good care of himself, and we're hoping this will be minor. But if it isn't, we've got other guys that can come in. It's what other teams have had to do this year." Smith, 35, stopped 23 of the 25 shots he faced Sunday in New York, improving his season record to 23-16-6. He has a 2.53 goals-against average and a .921 save percentage with two shutouts in 47 appearances. Smith is in his 12th NHL season, his first with the Flames. A fifth-round draft pick of the Stars in 2001, he spent 2006-07 and part of 2007-08 in Dallas before playing for the Tampa Bay Lightning (2007-08 to 2010-11) and the Phoenix/Arizona Coyotes (2011-12 to 2016-17). His career record is 217-214-66 with a 2.69 GAA and a .913 save percentage. Last June, Arizona dealt Smith to Calgary for goalie Chad Johnson, the rights to Boston University defenseman Brandon Hickey and a conditional 2018 draft pick. --Field Level Media
