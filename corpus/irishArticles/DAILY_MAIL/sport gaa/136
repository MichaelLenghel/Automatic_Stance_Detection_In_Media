Chicago Blackhawks goalie Corey Crawford took the loss Thursday night in his first appearance in nearly 10 months. Crawford, who hadn't been in the net since sustaining a concussion on Dec. 23, made 27 saves on 30 shots in a 4-1 loss to the Arizona Coyotes. "I think I felt better in the second and third (periods)," Crawford said. "But they really didn't get that many opportunities early. It was nice. I think they flipped one in for the first one, so that was kind of good just to get in it and feel one early." Crawford was still dealing with some of the effects of the concussion during training camp. He had been practicing with the Blackhawks since Sept. 29. "It feels good to be back to myself," Crawford said after Wednesday's practice. "I'm feeling clear." Crawford, 33, played in just 28 games last season when he went 16-9-2 with a 2.27 goals-against average. He was placed on injured reserve on Dec. 27, four days after the concussion. The Blackhawks won three times in five games during Crawford's absence, but replacement Cam Ward struggled with a 4.06 GAA and .879 save percentage. Chicago went to overtime in each of its first five games to set an NHL record. --Field Level Media
