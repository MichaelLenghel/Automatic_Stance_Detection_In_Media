The Edmonton Oilers and goaltender Mikko Koskinen agreed to a three-year, $13.5 million extension, according to multiple reports on Monday. Koskinen, from Finland, is earning $2.5 million this season on a one-year deal he signed in the offseason to return to the NHL. The 30-year-old is 14-10-1 with a 2.78 goals-against average and a .911 save percentage in 27 games (24 starts) this season. He spent the past seven years playing in Finland and Russia. "We are excited to have signed Mikko to a three-year contract extension through the 2022 season," Oilers general manager Peter Chiarelli said in a press release. "Mikko has a lot of experience as a number one goalie and has performed well both internationally and for our club." Koskinen was a second-round pick (31st overall) by the New York Islanders in the 2009 draft. He played in four games for the Islanders during the 2010-11 season, going 2-1 with a 4.33 GAA. --Field Level Media
