Napoli are ready to take advantage of Lucas Torreira's desire to leave Arsenal by making a move for him in January, according to reports in Italy. The Italian side are currently in the midst of a club civil war after their players and coaching staff refused to take part in a training camp organised by chairman Aurelio De Laurentiis. This has led to reports of a quick-fire sale next summer with Brazilian midfielder Allan expected to be one of the players heading for the exit at the San Paolo Stadium. According to Gazzetta dello Sport, Napoli are keen to find him replacement quickly and have identified Torreira as their main target in the upcoming winter window. Reports have also suggested that the Uruguayan’s agent Pablo Betancur has already told Arsenal's chiefs that Torreira wants a move away from the club in the hope of more minutes. Torreira has struggled to break into the Gunners' starting XI under Unai Emery and has often been played out of position, much to the annoyance of Arsenal supporters. The 28-year-old has previously been linked with Napoli before he completed his move to the Emirates in 2018. However, Arsenal are said to be keen on keeping Torreira at the club. Torreira has a long-term contract at Arsenal, which runs until the summer of 2023, but he was linked with a move away in the summer and his current situation will only increase speculation regarding his possible departure.
