The Tampa Bay Lightning got some salary-cap relief Tuesday by trading injured forward Ryan Callahan to the Ottawa Senators for goaltender Mike Condon. The teams also swapped 2020 draft picks, with the Lightning giving up a fifth-round selection and receiving the Senators' sixth-rounder in return. Callahan, 34, is not expected to play again due to a degenerative disc disease in his lumbar spine. He was placed on long-term injured reserve last month. His cap hit for 2019-20 is $5.8 million, but insurance will pick up 80 percent of his $4.7 million salary due to his IR status. Callahan had seven goals and 10 assists in 52 games last season. In 13 years with the New York Rangers (2006-14) and Lightning (2014-19), he tallied 254 points (132 goals, 122 assists) in 450 games. Condon, 29, allowed eight goals on 40 shots in two games with Ottawa in 2018-19. Condon has a 45-58-17 record and a 2.79 GAA in 129 games over four NHL seasons with Pittsburgh, Montreal and Ottawa. --Field Level Media
