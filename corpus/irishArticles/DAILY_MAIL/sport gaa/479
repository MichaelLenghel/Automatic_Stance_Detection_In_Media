DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) - Bangladesh's cricket players have decided to go on strike, stating that they won't take part in the sport until their 11-point demand is met. The players want an increased say in cricket matters and an improvement of domestic pay packages. They also urged for an improvement of pay packages for groundsmen, as well as more money for local coaches. No age-level cricket players were included among those seeking the 11-point demands. "We did not include under-19 team here as they are preparing for the World Cup. Everybody else is here and we know everybody is with us," Bangladesh test captain Shakib Al Hasan said. "We are not going to be involved in cricket unless our demand is fulfilled." Hasan said the strike is for domestic and first-class cricket to international cricket. "We could not include our women's cricketers because this decision was taken suddenly and if they have any demands they can include it with us," Hasan said. "I am sure they must have some demands and if they join us we can put it forward." Bangladesh Cricket Board CEO Nizamuddin Chwodhury said they would discuss the matter. "We have just been informed about the development through media. They (players) are yet to talk on this matter with us directly," Chowdhury said. "We surely will take a decision on this matter. At this point, I can't say anything on this." ___ More AP cricket: www.apnews.com/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
