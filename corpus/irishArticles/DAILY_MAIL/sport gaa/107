The Canadiens said Price will not travel to Florida for Friday's game against the Panthers. He will not be available Saturday at Tampa Bay or Monday at Dallas. Price has a 15-10-4 record, a 2.84 goals-against average and a .904 save percentage in 30 games this season. The 2014-15 Hart Trophy winner is in his 12th season with Montreal. He picked up his 300th career win on Dec. 20 at Arizona. Backup goalie Antti Niemi is 4-3-1 this season with a 4.14 GAA and .876 save percentage. The Canadiens, currently fifth in the Atlantic Division with 43 points, return home on Jan. 3 against the Vancouver Canucks. --Field Level Media
