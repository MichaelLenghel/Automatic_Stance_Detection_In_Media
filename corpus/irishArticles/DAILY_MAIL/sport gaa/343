Australian and Melbourne Renegades all-rounder Sophie Molineux is the latest cricketer to take a break from the sport to focus on her mental health. The Renegades announced on Friday that Molineux would miss this weekend's WBBL derby clash with the Melbourne Stars in Ballarat. Elite men's players Glenn Maxwell, Will Pucovski and Nic Maddinson have also recently stepped away from the sport for mental health reasons. Renegades coach Tim Coyle said Molineux, 21, had the club's full support. "Sophie knows her teammates and the Renegades coaches and support staff are always there for her," Coyle said. "We'll give Sophie the time, space and any support she needs," Coyle said. Molineux made her Test debut this year in Australia's victorious Ashes campaign in England. She will also continue working with Pip Inge, the Australia women's team doctor. "Sophie has made the decision to take a break from cricket and we are providing her with the support she needs," Inge said. "The welfare of our players is a priority and we are proud of the brave decision by Sophie to step away from the game." Makinley Blows has been brought into the Renegades squad for this weekend's match. The Renegades currently sit fifth on the WBBL table with four matches of the regular season remaining.
