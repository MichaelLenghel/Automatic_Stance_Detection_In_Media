The New York Islanders signed goalie Robin Lehner to a one-year deal on Tuesday, the team announced. Lehner played for the Buffalo Sabres the last three seasons, but the club declined to bring him back in June. Financial terms of his deal with the Islanders were not disclosed. Lehner, who turns 27 in July, was 14-26-9 last season, capping a three-season run in which he went 42-61-22 with just six shutout wins. He posted a 2.77 goals-against average and .916 save percentage in that time. The GAA and save percentage are better than the figures he posted in his first five seasons in the league, spent with Ottawa. Per the Buffalo News, Lehner -- coming off a year when he posted a career-high 23 wins with a 2.68 GAA -- tried playing through several injuries last season before being shut down in March. --Field Level Media
