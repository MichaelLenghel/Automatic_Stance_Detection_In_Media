Juventus are planning to rival Real Madrid for Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Christian Eriksen and will look to talk to the Dane when he is free to talk to other clubs in January, according to Corriere dello Sport. Eriksen's contract at the North London outfit expires in the summer, meaning that clubs are free to negotiate with him once the new year swings by. News of Eriksen's potential next move has dominated the front pages of the sport media outlets in Spain, with Diario AS claiming last month that Eriksen had been offered a new, improved deal at Spurs but was stalling on signing it as he considered his options. That came four months after the same outlet claimed that there was a 'verbal agreement' between the Denmark international and Madrid. However, Juventus appear to have entered the frame and are now said to be plotting a move for the former Ajax playmaker and steal him from under the noses of Florentino Perez and the Madrid hierarchy.  While it is unclear what the appointment of Jose Mourinho, who replaced Mauricio Pochettino as Spurs manager last Monday, will have on the situation, the Dane was left out of their win at West Ham because the Portuguese was unsure of the player's current mindset.   Mourinho has since stated that he has spoken to Eriksen about his future, but the details of the conversation will remain undisclosed until the release of the latest edition of Amazon's All or Nothing documentary series at the Premier League club this campaign. Eriksen, who has started just eight matches all season, has endured a poor campaign when he has featured, scoring just twice and recording just a single assist in all competitions.
