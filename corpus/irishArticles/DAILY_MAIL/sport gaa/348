Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is reluctant to sign a new Arsenal contract because he is waiting on Barcelona, according to SPORT.  The 30-year-old, who is under contract at the Emirates Stadium until 2021, is aware of Barca's interest and is willing to wait to whether they will submit a bid this term. The Gabon international, who was recently criticised by some Gunners supporters over his links to AFTV, began talks over renewing his contract in the summer. Appearances: 14 Goals: 9 Assists: None However, negotiations stalled after the former Borussia Dortmund star opted against signing an extension to his current deal.  The report claims Aubameyang is likely to delay his decision to see whether Arsenal can qualify for the Champions League, and is likely to push for a move if they fail to finish in the top four.  The reigning LaLiga champions are thought to be looking for attacking reinforcements to support Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez.
