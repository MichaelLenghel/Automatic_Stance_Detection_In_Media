Marco Silva has accepted his future is out of his hands after he received only lukewarm support from Everton's board. Director of football Marcel Brands spoke to the club's website on Friday and failed to give a ringing endorsement of Silva, saying: 'We know in sport, as always, you have to perform — that's me, the manager, the players, for everyone.  'It's also important, especially in this club, after a couple of years of instability, to stick together in this situation.' Everton have key matches at Leicester and Liverpool in the next five days. There is a feeling Silva will be axed if he loses those games, and he could not answer with confidence on Friday when asked if he believed he would still be in charge. The club are at a low ebb after last week's 2-0 defeat by Norwich and Silva admitted he is at the mercy of Brands and majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri as to how long he stays. 'I cannot answer directly about a situation that is not in my hands,' said Silva.  'Marcel did what he did as the sporting director of the club and that was answer all these doubts you have in your mind. The reaction from the fans was really disappointing at the end of the Norwich match and more personal for the manager. 'In football, normally the first reaction is against the manager. To win their confidence, I have to work for results.' Everton have opened talks with Richarlison about a new deal.
