The Arizona Coyotes claimed goaltender Calvin Pickard off waivers from the Philadelphia Flyers, the team announced Thursday. Pickard was 4-2-2 with a 4.01 goals-against average and .863 save percentage in 11 games with the Flyers this season. Arizona was looking for goaltender depth after starter Antti Raanta left Tuesday's game against the Minnesota Wild with a lower-body injury. Pickard, 26, is 32-46-9 with a 2.89 GAA and .909 save percentage in 98 games (83 starts) since entering the league with the Colorado Avalanche in 2014-15. He started 48 games for the Avalanche in 2016-17 when he went 15-31-2 with a 2.98 GAA and .904 save percentage. In a corresponding move, the Coyotes assigned forward Mario Kempe to the Tucson Roadrunners of the American Hockey League. Kempe was scoreless in four games. --Field Level Media
