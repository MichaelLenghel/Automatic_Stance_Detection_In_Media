UFC star Conor McGregor has sparked fresh rumours that he could be set for a mega-fight at Ireland's Croke Park Stadium. The 29-year-old mixed martial artist has always expressed a desire to fight on home turf and there would be no bigger venue than the GAA in Dublin.  In a cryptic message posted on his Instagram account, McGregor revealed he was 'working on something BIG' as he smiled for some snaps with his son at the stadium. McGregor also took to Twitter to inform his fans what could be happening and confirmed all will be revealed soon.  In the early hours of Saturday morning, he wrote: 'Down at Croke Park with my little champion tonight. I am working on something BIG with @betsafe down here. Stay tuned!' His coach John Kavanagh has previously said it is not plausible to fight there as half the money generated by the fight would go on taxes and the show would have to run on Las Vegas time.  It is not clear yet what the likeable Irishman's next move will be following his multi-million boxing fight against Floyd Mayweather. Some suggest he is set for a return to UFC while others say he will try his hand in the ring again if the money is right.  UFC chief Dana White last month had insisted he would face the interim lightweight champion Tony Ferguson before the end of the year but those talks have since gone quiet. Whatever his next move is McGregor clearly has his sights set on fighting in Dublin again despite there being a few hurdles to overcome.
