The Carolina Hurricanes acquired goaltender James Reimer from the Florida Panthers on Sunday in exchange for goalie Scott Darling and a sixth-round pick in the 2020 NHL Draft. The Panthers then placed Darling on unconditional waivers for the purpose of a buyout. TSN reported that Florida would end up with a salary cap savings of $2.17 million next season and $1.07 million in 2020-21 after the transactions. Reimer, 31, was 13-12-5 last season with the Panthers, appearing in 36 games (29 starts). He had a 3.09 goals-against average and a .900 save percentage. He spent the past three seasons with Florida, with a 53-42-16 record, a 2.85 GAA and a .912 save percentage. The native of Canada was a fourth-round pick of the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 2006 draft and has spent nine seasons in the NHL, including with Toronto (2010-2016) and the San Jose Sharks (2016). Reimer is 144-120-39 in his career, with a 2.81 GAA and a .914 save percentage. Darling, 30, was disappointing in Carolina, starting only eight games last season after signing a four-year contract in 2017. He posted a 15-25-9 record, a 3.20 GAA and an .887 save percentage in two seasons with the Hurricanes. Darling has started 112 games in a five-season NHL career, including three as a backup with the Chicago Blackhawks, going 54-42-18 with a 2.72 GAA and .908 save percentage. --Field Level Media
