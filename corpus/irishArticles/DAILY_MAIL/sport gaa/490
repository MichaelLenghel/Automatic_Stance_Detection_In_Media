The Premier League fixtures for the Christmas period have finally been revealed, with Arsenal vs Manchester United featuring as the headline act of a nine-game bonanza on New Years Day. Broadcasters have been falling over themselves to get a cut of the action, meaning almost all matches over the festive period will be accessible on television. Arsenal's New Year's Day encounter with rivals United has been penciled for an 8pm kick-off, with all matches earlier in the day also set to be screened by BT Sport with staggered kick-off times. Scroll down for the full run of fixtures, and broadcasters  The arrival of Amazon Prime onto the scene has shaken up the landscape further, with the American giant showing the round of fixtures due on December 3 and 4, with games including Manchester United versus Tottenham and the Merseyside Derby between Liverpool and Everton. With Amazon taking complete control of Boxing Day football, kick-off times are to be staggered in slots of 12pm, 3pm, 5.30pm and 8pm, in order to accommodate all of the action.  Tottenham and Brighton start the day with a 12.30pm kick-off, with Liverpool and Leicester bringing the bumper run to a close with their 8pm meeting. Some of the kick-off times will come as an inconvenience to travelling supporters, with some clubs already acting to ease the process.  Liverpool have informed fans a free coach service will be provided for the Boxing Day fixture with the Foxes at the King Power Stadium. Reds fans have been left furious with the unusual late kick-off the day after Christmas, and have made their thoughts known. The Spirit of Shankly supporters group have called for the Premier League to adjust the kick-off, for the wellbeing of both clubs. 'The latest round of televised Premier League games has been announced and once again there is scant, if any, consideration given to match-going supporters and those employed at the stadiums,' said the group in a statement. 'Both sets of supporters will encounter difficulty getting to and from the stadium. (Liverpool fans) will not get home until after midnight and the following day is back to work for many. 'And let's not forget the Leicester City employees and those working in public services who will be required to work these hours. How will they get there, and how will they get home? 'The Premier League and TV companies repeatedly ignore the welfare of supporters. But they do have a chance to redeem themselves. 'Spirit of Shankly call on the authorities to do the right thing and revert all Boxing Day fixtures to a sensible kick-off time. We suggest 3pm.' It is the first time such volume of live football has been broadcast during the busiest period in the English football calendar, and could be a sign of things to come for future live football arrangements. The full run of fixtures finally arrive after being five days late from the original scheduled release. The delay had left many fans frustrated at being unable to make plans and book travel over the busy festive period.  Many representatives from football clubs voiced their opinion, with The Chelsea Supporters' Trust among those stating: 'These fixtures are five days late. This impacts on family arrangements, the price of train tickets, the ability to book leave and much more. 'It is especially sensitive over Christmas, when match-going fans already have challenges regarding fitting in with family arrangements.' While the Newcastle United Supporters' Trust added: 'Due to our geography, Newcastle fans naturally end up paying way more on average to follow their team on the road. 'The longer we wait for confirmation of away fixtures, the more expensive the trip becomes. 'Throw Christmas into the mix, naturally a busier and more expensive time of year, and some fans are faced with a huge financial burden if they want to follow their team away from home thanks to yet another delay.'
