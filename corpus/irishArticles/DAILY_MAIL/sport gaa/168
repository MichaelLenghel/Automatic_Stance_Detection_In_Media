The Detroit Red Wings have brought back left wing Thomas Vanek on a one-year deal and signed goaltender Jonathan Bernier to a three-year deal, the team announced Sunday. No terms were announced, but both deals will average $3 million annually, according to multiple reports. The team also officially announced the re-signing of defenseman Mike Green to a two-year, $10.75 million deal, as well as the additions of left wing Chris Terry on a two-year deal, and goaltender Harri Sateri, center Wade Megan and defenseman Jake Chelios on one-year deals. Chelios is the son of Chris Chelios, who played 10 seasons with the Red Wings. Vanek, 34, signed with Detroit exactly two years ago in free agency, collecting 15 goals and 23 assists in 48 games before the Red Wings traded him to the Panthers at the deadline. Vanek signed a one-year deal with the Vancouver Canucks last summer in free agency, before being dealt again at the deadline, this time to the Columbus Blue Jackets. Vanek has played no more than two seasons for seven different teams since spending the first eight-plus years of his career with the Buffalo Sabres. He finished last season with 56 points (24 goals, 32 assists) in 80 games, his highest total since the 2013-14 season (68). Bernier, who turns 30 in August, started 34 games last season for the Colorado Avalanche, going 19-13-3 with a pair of shutouts and a .913 save percentage and 2.85 goals-against average. Detroit will be his fifth team, after he spent five years with the Kings, three with the Maple Leafs and one with the Ducks before joining the Avs. The Avalanche did not try to keep Bernier after acquiring Philipp Grubauer from the Washington Capitals earlier this offseason. The 32-year-old Green had 33 points (eight goals, 25 assists) in 66 games last season. His season was cut short by a neck injury that required surgery, but he is expected to be healthy for training camp. Terry, 29, was a regular for the Carolina Hurricanes from 2014-16, tallying 31 points (19 goals, 12 assists) in 125 games over the two-season span, but he played just 14 games with the Montreal Canadiens last year. He spent 62 games with the AHL Laval Rocket, collecting 32 goals and 39 assists but finishing minus-33 on the season. Staeri, 28, made his NHL debut last season for the Florida Panthers, posting a 2.92 GAA and .911 save percentage in nine games (seven starts) and going 4-4. Megan, 27, appeared in four NHL games with the St. Louis Blues from 2016-17, scoring one goal. He had 33 points in 63 games for the AHL's Chicago Wolves last season. Chelios, 27, had 63 points from 2015-17 with the AHL's Charlotte Checkers, but finished with just 14 points in 41 games last season. He has yet to make his NHL debut. --Field Level Media
