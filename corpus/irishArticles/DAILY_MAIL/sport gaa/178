The Carolina Panthers acquired Dougie Hamilton, Micheal Ferland and Harvard defenseman Adam Fox from the Calgary Flames in exchange for Noah Hanifin and Elias Lindholm on Saturday. Hamilton, 25, produced 17 goals and 27 assists in 82 games for the Flames last season. The defenseman has 220 points in 423 career games with Calgary and Boston after being taken No. 9 overall in 2011 by the Bruins. Hanifin, a 21-year-old defenseman, established career highs with 10 goals and 32 points in his third NHL season and was selected for his first All-Star Game. He will be a restricted free agent this offseason. Lindholm, a 23-year-old center, also becomes a restricted free agent July 1. His 16 goals and 44 points last season were each one short of his career highs. Ferland, 26, played in 77 games last season and tallied 21 goals and 20 assists. He has 89 points in 250 career games. --The Colorado Avalanche signed Philipp Grubauer to a three-year contract one day after acquiring the goaltender from the Washington Capitals. Grubauer appeared in 35 games (28 starts) in his sixth NHL season and went 15-10-3 with a 2.35 goals-against average. He is expected to challenge Semyon Varlamov for the starting job. Varlamov went 24-16-6 with a 2.68 GAA in 51 games (47 starts) last season before suffering a season-ending knee injury. --Ilya Kovalchuk is returning to the NHL after agreeing to a three-year deal with the Los Angeles Kings. Kovalchuk retired in June 2013 with 12 years and $77 million remaining on a 15-year deal he signed with the New Jersey Devils in 2010. Because he was designated to the voluntary retirement list, Kovalchuk's rights belonged to the Devils until he turned 35 on April 15. After leaving the NHL, Kovalchuk went on to star in Russia's Kontinental Hockey League for the last five seasons. Kovalchuk had 31 goals and 32 assists in 53 games with St. Petersburg this season, leading the KHL in scoring. --Field Level Media
