July 2 (Reuters) - The Montreal Canadiens signed goaltender Carey Price to an eight-year, $84 million contract extension on Sunday to keep him with the team through the 2025-26 season. The deal is worth a reported $10.5 million per year starting with the 2018-19 season. Price, 29, completed his 10th season in the NHL, all with the Canadiens, in 2016-17. He maintained a record of 37-20-5 in 62 games, posting three shutouts, a 2.23 goals-against average and a .923 save percentage. Since 2007-08, Price owns a 270-175-55 record in 509 regular-season games, with a 2.40 GAA and a .920 save percentage. He ranks fourth in Canadiens history with 39 shutouts. - - - The Chicago Blackhawks traded forward Marcus Kruger to the Vegas Golden Knights in exchange for future considerations. Kruger, 27, registered 105 points (33 goals, 72 assists) in 398 career regular-season games with Chicago in seven seasons, including winning two Stanley Cup titles. He had five goals and 12 assists in 70 games in 2016-17. The 6-foot, 186-pound Kruger just completed the first year of a three-year deal that carries a salary-cap hit of $3.083 million. The Blackhawks reportedly were over next season's salary cap of $75 million by about $2.1 million before the trade. - - - The Florida Panthers announced Saturday night that they are parting ways with veteran Jaromir Jagr. The future Hall of Famer turned 45 in February and is no longer the scoring threat he was in his prime. He ranks third in NHL history with 765 goals and second with 1,914 points. Jagr, a 10-time All-Star, scored 16 goals and 46 points this past season. He played two-plus seasons with the Panthers. Jagr recently said on Twitter that he hopes to play next season. - - - The Panthers signed forward Sebastian Repo to a three-year, entry-level contract. Repo, 21, appeared in 46 regular-season games for Tampere Tappara of Finland's Liiga, collecting 32 points (11 goals, 21 assists), and he appeared in eight games with the Lahti Pelicans, posting three assists. The 6-foot-2, 198-pound native of Lahti, Finland, registered six goals and one assist in 18 playoff games with Tampere en route to a Liiga Championship. Repo was originally selected by Florida in the sixth round of the 2017 NHL draft.
