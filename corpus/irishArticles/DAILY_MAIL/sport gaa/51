The Calgary Flames signed goaltender David Rittich to a two-year, $5.5 million on Saturday to avoid arbitration. The two sides appeared on track for a hearing on Monday before getting the deal done. "I'm super excited," Rittich told the team's website. "I love it in Calgary. The organization gave me a chance to become a goalie in this league, and now I'm hoping to re-pay them with my play. "To get it done before arbitration is even better. No one wants to go through that." Rittich, 26, went 27-9-5 with a 2.61 goals-against average and .911 save percentage in 45 games (42 starts) last season. The goalie nicknamed "Big Save Dave" is 35-15-8 with a 2.70 GAA and .909 save percentage in 67 career NHL games. The Czech Republic native is expected to share the goaltending duties with recently signed Cam Talbot. --Field Level Media
