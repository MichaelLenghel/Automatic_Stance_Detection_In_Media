The Anaheim Ducks sent left wing Andrew Cogliano to the Dallas Stars in exchange for center Devin Shore on Monday. Cogliano, 31, had 11 points (three goals, eight assists) in 46 games for the Ducks this season, his eighth in Anaheim after four seasons in Edmonton. Since he was acquired from the Oilers in a trade in 2011, he has registered 233 points (102 goals, 131 assists) in 584 games. Cogliano holds the fourth-longest consecutive games streak in NHL history (830 games), recorded from Oct. 4, 2007-Jan. 13, 2018. He has missed just two games in his career, both because of a two-game suspension in January 2018. The Stars selected Shore, 24, with their second-round pick (No. 61) in the 2012 NHL Draft. In 42 games this season, he has 17 points (five goals, 12 assists) and overall, he has 82 points (29 goals, 53 assists) in 209 NHL games. --Toronto Maple Leafs goaltender Frederik Andersen was back in the net for Monday's home game against the Colorado Avalanche. Andersen has been sidelined since suffering a groin injury on Dec. 22. Andersen, 29, was 20-9-1 with a 2.50 goals-against average and .923 save percentage before he was injured in a game against the New York Rangers. Andersen has a career mark of 168-72-32 with a 2.54 GAA and .918 save percentage over six NHL seasons with the Anaheim Ducks (2013-16) and Maple Leafs. --Defenseman Josh Gorges announced his retirement after 13 NHL seasons. The 34-year-old Gorges revealed his decision through the NHL Players' Association. Gorges wasn't affiliated with a team this season. His contract with the Buffalo Sabres ran out after last season. Gorges scored 124 points (17 goals, 107 assists) in 783 regular-season games and also blocked 1,519 shots. Gorges broke in with the San Jose Sharks in 2005 and spent parts of two seasons with that franchise before being dealt to the Montreal Canadiens. He played with Montreal from 2007-14 before playing his final four seasons with the Sabres. --The San Jose Sharks signed forward Marcus Sorensen to a two-year extension, the team announced. The deal places Sorensen under contract through the 2020-21 campaign. Financial terms weren't disclosed. Sorensen has eight goals and seven assists in 47 games this season. Sorensen has 14 goals and 12 assists in 98 career NHL games over parts of three seasons, all with San Jose. --Field Level Media
