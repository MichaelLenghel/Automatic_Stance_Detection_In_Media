Manchester City star Sergio Aguero was involved in a minor car crash as he made his way to training on Wednesday morning. The Argentine was travelling to Etihad Campus facility when his £150,000 LUMMA CLR SV Range Rover Sport was involved in an accident. The 31-year-old fortunately walked away from the crash unscathed as images showed serious damage to the car's front-right wheel. Sky Sports presenter David Gorrido said: 'We understand he is unhurt after being involved in a small car collision, we've been told that he's had a bump this morning. 'It's been described as a minor plan, but has reported to the CFA - City Football Academy as well as the rest of the Manchester City squad and we understand he didn't need to be checked the by medical team.' Aguero was not called up by his country during the international break as he struggled with a slight heel problem.  Two years ago, Aguero was involved in a crash in Amsterdam and suffered broken ribs.  He was a passenger that time in a taxi that collided with a pole. While initial reports suggested that he'd miss up to six weeks, Aguero returned to action two weeks later before going on to score his 177th goal for City in a 3–0 win over Burnley, equalling the club's record goalscorer Eric Brook at the time. He would become the club's top goalscorer shortly after.  Aguero will be available for selection when City travel to Selhurst Park to face Crystal Palace on Saturday.
