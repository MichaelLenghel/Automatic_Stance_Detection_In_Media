A 14-year-old boy who died after a kitesurfing incident in Sydney is the son of a well-known competitor in the action sport. Alexi Bader's kite was caught in a strong gust of wind off Silver Beach at Kurnell on Saturday before he landed heavily on rocks.  The teenager, who is the son of famous kiteboarder Christelle Le Baccon, was rushed to hospital, but died from his injuries.    Kiteboarding NSW president Ben Herrald said Alexi's death was 'devastating'. 'I haven't heard of any (fatal kitesurfing accidents) for years and years, it's a freak accident,' Mr Herrald told The Daily Telegraph. 'I couldn't imagine (what his family is going through), I'm a father myself.' 'It's a tight-knit community, even though there are thousands of people most people know each other. Everyone is feeling it for (the family) today.' Marine Area Command officers are looking into the incident, and a report will be prepared for the coroner.
