Tampa Bay Lightning goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy has been named to the NHL All-Star Game as a replacement for Montreal's Carey Price. Vasilevskiy will be on the Atlantic Division squad after Price -- who has battled a lower-body injury for several weeks -- withdrew Monday in order to get rest. Vasilevskiy is 16-4-2 with a 2.66 goals-against average and a .920 save percentage this season. The 24-year-old Vasilevskiy missed 14 games earlier this season due to a broken left foot. Vasilevskiy was a finalist for the Vezina Trophy as the league's top goalkeeper last season when he went 44-17-3 with a 2.62 GAA and .920 save percentage. He tied for the league high in victories and in shutouts (eight). Price faces a mandatory one-game suspension for skipping the contest, slated for Jan. 26 in San Jose, Calif. Washington Capitals star Alex Ovechkin previously pulled out of the contest and also faces a one-game suspension. --Field Level Media
