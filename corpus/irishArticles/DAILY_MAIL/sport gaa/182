Los Angeles FC seeks to continue its unbeaten streak at home when the Columbus Crew visits on Saturday. The first-year club is 2-0-3 at Banc of California Stadium playing in front of enthusiastic sellouts of 22,000. This will be the first meeting with the Crew, one of the original MLS franchises from 1996. "The excitement of the crowd, the quality of the stadium will be fun to see," Crew midfielder and captain Wil Trapp said. "Look, we're going there to get three points. That's the point of this trip." After a 2-0 home loss to Atlanta United on June 13, Columbus (7-4-6) has a loss and four ties in its last five matches. The Crew are third in the Eastern Conference while LAFC (7-4-3) holds the same position in the West. "They're a team that can score in multiple ways," Trapp said. "For a team that's in their first year they're very organized. (Coach) Bob Bradley has them very confident, playing well." Columbus will be without goalkeeper Zack Steffen, who sustained a knee injury during training on Thursday. He has 0.79 goals-against average in 14 games. Jon Kempin (1-0-2, 1.67 GAA) will likely start. LAFC forwards Carlos Vela (Mexico) and Marco Ureña (Costa Rica) are with their respective countries for the FIFA 2018 World Cup in Russia, but defender Laurent Ciman of Belgium was released to return to Los Angeles. He was on standby in case of injury. If he plays Saturday, he and his teammates will track Crew forward Gyasi Zardes, who is tied for second in MLS with 10 goals. "He plays in a system where they like to get the ball wide and whip crosses into the box so he's finding a lot of success with tap-in goals and very close-range finishes," LAFC defender Walker Zimmerman said. --Field Level Media
