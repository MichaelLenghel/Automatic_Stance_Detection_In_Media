Arsenal have appointed sports performance specialist Barry Solan to their backroom team. Solan will be current head of performance enhancement Shad Forsythe's assistant, but his official title is strength and conditioning coach. He currently works in gaelic football with Mayo GAA, but will join up with the Gunners for next season. Former Germany coach Forsythe was appointed by Arsenal to head up the club's fitness division ahead of last season. Forsythe and Solan have worked together before for sports performance firm EXOS. Arsenal have had long-standing issues with keeping their first-team stars fit. Last season there were lengthy injuries suffered by defenders Mathieu Debuchy and Laurent Koscielny, midfielders Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Jack Wilshere and Mesut Ozil, and strikers Olivier Giroud and Danny Welbeck. Long-term crock Abou Diaby has now left the Gunners' treatment table after being released by the club.
