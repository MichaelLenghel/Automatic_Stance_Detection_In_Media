Pittsburgh Penguins starting goalie Matt Murray was activated from injured reserve Wednesday morning, announced executive vice president and general manager Jim Rutherford. Murray returned to practice Tuesday after being placed on IR Nov. 22 with a lower-body injury. He's missed the last 11 games. The Penguins visit the Blackhawks on Wednesday then host the Boston Bruins on Friday and Los Angeles Kings on Saturday. It is unclear which game will mark Murray's return to a starting role. Tristan Jarry was returned to Wilkes-Barre/Scranton of the AHL to make room on the roster. "It's still undecided," Murray told reporters Tuesday when asked about playing against the Blackhawks. "I still have to talk to the doctors and stuff like that. But the progression is there. So it's still undecided. ... It feels good (to practice). You kind of take it for granted how much fun it is to be out there with the team." Murray, who missed time earlier this season due to a concussion, has struggled when on the ice, posting a 4-5-1 record and a 4.08 goals-against average. His backup, Casey DeSmith, is 9-4-4 with a 2.34 GAA. Murray hasn't played since being pulled after allowing three goals on 10 shots in the first period of a 6-4 loss at Ottawa on Nov. 17. Still, Penguins coach Mike Sullivan is looking forward to getting the two-time Stanley Cup-winning goalie back. "We'd like to get him involved as soon as we can," Sullivan said regarding Murray on Tuesday. "We're playing a lot of games here so we need two goalies to participate, to help us. And Matt's obviously an important part of this team, so we'd like to get him involved as soon as we can. When we know he's at his best, he's our No. 1 goalie." --Field Level Media
