New Jersey Devils goaltender Cory Schneider could return from a groin injury to play in Wednesday's game against the Florida Panthers. Schneider has missed five weeks due to the injury that occurred on Jan. 23 against the Boston Bruins. He participated in a full practice with the Devils on Monday and was scheduled to play for Binghamton on Tuesday after being assigned to the American Hockey League team on a conditioning loan. The 31-year-old Schneider feels he is ready to get back in the New Jersey net. "I've had some good volume the last few days," Schneider said after Monday's practice. "I think we're at a point where we're going to make a decision one way or another. I feel about as good as I'm going to, so hopefully I can get back into the lineup as a backup first or to play a game. I just want to get back to playing hockey." Schneider is 17-11-6 this season with a 2.79 goals-against average and .913 save percentage. In parts of 10 NHL seasons, Schneider is 161-135-52 with a 2.33 GAA and .921 save percentage. --Field Level Media
