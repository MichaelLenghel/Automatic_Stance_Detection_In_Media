Goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky signed a seven-year contract with the Florida Panthers on Monday, another key player to depart the Columbus Blue Jackets on the first day of NHL free agency. Financial terms were not released, but TSN reported the deal has an annual average value of $10 million. The Sun-Sentinel verified that average by reporting the deal is worth $70 million. "Sergei is an elite starting goaltender who has consistently proven to be one of the best in the NHL," Panthers president of hockey operations and general manager Dale Tallon in a statement. "Adding a world class goalie with Sergei's abilities and experience will give us a solid foundation in net and the confidence to win every night as we look towards this next era of Panthers hockey in South Florida." Bobrovsky, 30, registered a 37-24-1 record in 62 games with the Blue Jackets in 2018-19. He also had a .913 save percentage, 2.58 goals against average and a career-best nine shutouts. He led the NHL in shutouts. In the postseason, he played in all 10 of the Blue Jackets' games, finishing 6-4 with a 2.41 GAA and a .925 save percentage. Bobrovsky won the Vezina Trophy as the league's top goaltender in 2013 and 2017. Undrafted, he played four seasons in the Kontinental Hockey League and signed with the Philadelphia Flyers in 2010. The Flyers traded him to Columbus on June 22, 2012, and he spent the next seven seasons in Ohio. In 457 career games (446 starts), Bobrovsky has a 255-153-37 record with a 2.46 GAA and a .919 save percentage. Meanwhile, the Panthers also added defenseman Anton Stralman, who spent the past five seasons with the Tampa Bay Lightning. Stralman has 242 career points (47 goals, 195 assists) in 749 games over 12 seasons. "Anton is a veteran two-way defenseman who plays solid hockey and brings a wealth of experience and leadership to our lineup," Tallon said. "His knowledge of the game and winning mentality will be a valuable asset for our young defensemen." Also on Monday, the Blue Jackets lost free agents Artemi Panarin (New York Rangers) and Matt Duchene (Nashville Predators). --Field Level Media
