Tip-Off on Monday night. The Wildcats (3-2) advance to play Pittsburgh, which defeated Kansas State in the opening semifinal, on Wednesday.

Northwestern scored the next 11 points/ The Wildcats produced a 9-0 surge to take a 32-17 lead following a tip-in by Robbie Beran off his own miss. The Braves opened the game making three of their first four shots before enduring an icy 3-for-23 spell over the next 18-plus minutes to fall behind 39-21 at halftime.
