Pittsburgh Penguins goaltender Matt Murray shined in his return against the Toronto Maple Leafs on Thursday after missing three games with a concussion. Murray's concussion occurred during a practice last week. It is his second known concussion in nine months and third of his career. His return came against the league's top offense in the Maple Leafs, who entered the day averaging 4.71 goals per game. But Murray stood tall as he stopped all 38 shots he faced to earn his first shutout of the season and the seventh of his career. "Every game is hard. We have so much respect for this league and how good the teams are. When's the ideal time to bring a guy back into the lineup? I'm not sure there is one," Penguins coach Mike Sullivan told reporters. "Matt's our No. 1 goalie. He's healthy. He's had a number of good practices. He's prepared for it. We just gotta go out and play well in front of him." Murray has allowed 11 goals in three games this season. The 24-year-old has a career record of 70-29-8. His backup, Casey DeSmith, went 1-0-2 with a 2.59 GAA and .922 save percentage in his three starts. The Penguins are 3-1-2 to begin the season. --Field Level Media
