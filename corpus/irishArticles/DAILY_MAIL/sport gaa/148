This is the shocking moment a football fan kicked a homeless man in the face. Patrick Paget filmed the Dublin GAA fan attack the man in front of a crowd of people in the Irish capital on Sunday evening, Dublin Live reports.  The short clip shows the man, wearing his team's jersey, viciously kick the homeless man as he sat on the pavement with a sleeping bag around him. Another man is seen trying to hold him back and shield the victim while others also intervene to stop the assault. Mr Paget filmed the scene from across the street and posted it to his Facebook page. The Dubliner wrote that he'd had a great day until he witnessed the unprovoked attack. 'Had a great day working in Croker… Dublin taking the sam four times in a row… Only to be walking home and see this on our streets #terrible #horrible #scumshouldbeashamed,' he wrote on Facebook. He added to Dublin Live that the victim had been 'minding his own business' when the fan suddenly targeted him before walking off. 'It was horrible. The poor guy was just sitting with a sleeping bag around him minding his own business,' he said. 'Other people tried to stop the man who did it, and he then just walked off.' Gardaí are investigating the incident which occurred in the Parnell Street area on Dublin's northside, according to the Irish Independent.
