The Columbus Blue Jackets acquired goaltender Keith Kinkaid from the New Jersey Devils on Monday. The Blue Jackets will send a fifth-round pick in the 2022 NHL Draft to the Devils in exchange. The Devils signed the undrafted Kinkaid in 2011, and he has played in 151 career games (132 starts). He has a 64-55-17 record with a 2.90 GAA, .906 save percentage and seven shutouts. Kinkaid, 29, posted a 15-18-6 record, a 3.36 GAA and three shutouts in 41 games (38 starts) with the Devils this season. "While we believe goaltending is a position of strength for our club with Sergei Bobrovsky and Joonas Korpisalo, we thought it was important to add depth to the position," Columbus general manager Jarmo Kekalainen said. --Field Level Media
