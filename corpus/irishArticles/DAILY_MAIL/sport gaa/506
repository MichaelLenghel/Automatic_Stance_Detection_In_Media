Arturo Vidal says his new Barcelona team-mate Antoine Griezmann has found life difficult since his move to the club, according to Diario Sport (via Football Espana). Barcelona brought in the Frenchman for £108million over the summer, and scored twice on his debut for the side. However, since then, he has only added one more goal.  'It has been difficult for him to integrate and adapt,' said the Chilean midfielder. 'He has arrived at the best team in the world, with the best players,' he added. Barcelona have spent nearly £1billion over the past five years on new players, adding to the likes of Lionel Messi. Griezmann arrived from Atletico Madrid, where he scored 94 goals in 180 appearances from 2014-2019.  'He has come from a side that plays a very different way to Barcelona,' said Vidal. 'But we know that he has a lot of quality and he is one of the best players in the world. 'We need to give him time, and once he knows exactly what the manager wants from him, he will help the team a lot.'   After a rocky start to the season, Barcelona are now back on track in the league with three wins on the bounce.  They sit two points behind Real Madrid at the top of La Liga, and one point above Griezmann's former team Atletico Madrid.  The Catalans will be hoping the forward can get back to his best form as they look to keep pace with their rivals.
