Philadelphia Flyers goaltender Brian Elliott will miss the next two weeks with what the club termed Friday as a lower-body injury. Elliott was injured during the third period of Thursday's loss to the New Jersey Devils. He crouched in discomfort before leaving the ice. "It was worse than I expected," Flyers general manager Ron Hextall told reporters on Friday. "But that's the way it is." Elliott is 6-7-0 with a 2.59 goals-against average and .911 save percentage in 14 games (13 starts) this season. The 33-year-old Elliott is in his second season with the Flyers. He went 23-11-7 with a 2.66 GAA and .909 save percentage in 43 games (42 starts) last season. Cal Pickard is expected to see most of the action during Elliott's absence. Pickard is 3-1-1 with a 4.33 GAA and .865 save percentage this season. Philadelphia recalled goalie Alex Lyon from Lehigh Valley of the American Hockey League on Friday. Lyon is 2-2 with a 3.54 GAA in four games. Lyon appeared in 11 games (seven starts) for the Flyers last season, going 4-2-1 with a 2.75 GAA. --Field Level Media
