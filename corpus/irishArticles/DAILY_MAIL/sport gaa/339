Premier League clubs face a fight to book the best warm weather training camps when February's TV fixtures are announced, according to The Athletic. The majority of squads are expected to make the most of the new two-week winter break by jetting off to state-of-the-art bases in the likes of Dubai, Spain and America. But with Sky and BT Sport not expected to confirm which games they will be broadcasting either side of the break until mid-December, clubs have been unable to confirm their travel or accommodation plans. A set of top-flight fixtures will be split over two weekends in February, ensuring every club gets two weeks of rest without a competitive game. For example, teams playing in the Champions League are very likely to play on the weekend of February 8-9 and will not play again until at least February 22. However, at present all 10 fixtures are listed to be played on February 8. Five of them will be moved, but only when Sky and BT announce what they will be showing live. The Athletic claim that this delay will leave clubs scrambling to secure the best facilities abroad so that their players can recover away from the harsh British winter. Manchester United, for example, have been regular visitors to Dubai in recent years and trained at Nad Sheba Sports Complex for five days in January.  Liverpool travelled to Marbella in May to prepare for the Champions League final, while Tottenham took a mid-season trip to Barcelona in March.
