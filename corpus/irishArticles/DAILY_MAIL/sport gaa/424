Bologna have firmed up their interest in Zlatan Ibrahimovic, with their president Joey Saputo having given the go-ahead for the club to offer the Swede an 18-month contract worth £8m a-year, according to Corriere dello Sport. The 38-year-old striker is currently under contract at LA Galaxy, but his deal with the MLS outfit expires in December. The former Juventus, Inter Milan and AC Milan forward has therefore been linked with a return to Serie A, with Napoli having been heavily linked in recent weeks. A move to Naples would see Ibrahimovic reunite with coach Carlo Ancelotti once again, but a transfer to Bologna has also been touted due to his friendship with Sinisa Mihaijovic.  However, the Italian outlet has now claimed that Bologna president Joey Saputo wants the 38-year-old at the club. Saputo, who also owns MLS club Montreal Impact, is said to be willing to meet Zlatan's wage demands, believed to be in the region of €8m for an 18-month contract.  The report also states however that Saputo would look to sponsors to help finance the deal. Ibrahimovic has an excellent track record in Serie A, having played in Italy for a total of seven seasons, scoring 122 goals. The news comes a few days after Ibrahimovic himself appeared to hint that he was returning to La Liga. But the cryptic tweet turned out to be nothing more than a gambling promotion, which infuriated some of his fans.
