Roy Keane has been pencilled in to play the role of player-manager for a Manchester United legends team in a tribute match for Liam Miller next month. Former midfielder Miller, who played for United, Celtic and Ireland, died aged 36 earlier this year following a short battle with pancreatic cancer. The charity match will take place in front of a sell-out crowd of 45,000 at Pairc Ui Chaoimh and proceeds will be used to help Miller's widow Clare, their three children and the Marymount Hospice where he spent his final days.

'We would like to thank everyone again for their fabulous support. 'It's a ringing endorsement of the GAA's decision to donate the use of their stadium and we thank them wholeheartedly. 'This will be a unique sporting occasion in Cork, not only because of the calibre of the soccer stars who will be taking part, but also because it will feature both soccer and GAA sports at the same time. 'It will be a fantastic tribute to Liam Miller who was one of Cork's sporting heroes and a great celebration of sport in Cork.' Keane and Miller were briefly team-mates at United in 2004 and 2005. They also played together for Ireland.
