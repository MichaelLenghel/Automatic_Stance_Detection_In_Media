He's famed for being something of a musical bad boy. But Justin Bieber, 23, appears to have mellowed in recent years - and he proved it by tenderly hugging a fan in Ireland after playing a sellout gig at Dublin's RDS arena. The tattooed hunk looked cool and casual in his laidback ensemble - but appeared to mix up the country with Scotland as he donned a pair of red tartan trousers. Scroll down for video  Slinging his arm around the Cellbridge local, Mark Smith, the Canadian crooner smiled and chatted away to him as though he were an old friend. Mark held his hand over his mouth in disbelief as the A-list idol ambled along the street with his new pal.  Mark is taking part in a Lip Sync Battle fundraiser for Celbridge GAA over the weekend and appeared to be getting some tips from Justin. The pair shared a sweet embrace, with the handsome Sorry hitmaker looking genuinely pleased to meet him. Justin had sent fans into meltdown after being spotted hanging out in Kildare town in Dublin, and hours later, he was pictured casually playing basketball in Terenure’s Bushy Park. Photos began circulating on Twitter of the Canadian star casually looking at his phone in Picaderos restaurant in Maynooth. Eanna McDermott, who was working at the diner when Justin walked in, told the Irish Sun that the Despacito singer was 'very quiet and reserved'. He said: 'He came in about 2.30 this afternoon with his bodyguard. He was on his own and was very quiet and reserved.' After a troubled time four years ago, when the singer was just 19, Justin has been working on turning around his image and wellbeing. Reflecting on the darker place he used to be in, he posted an image of his mugshot to his Instagram page, captioning the photo 'jail is not a cool place to be' and 'never again'.
