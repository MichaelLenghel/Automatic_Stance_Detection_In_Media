The Detroit Red Wings signed veteran goaltender Jimmy Howard to a one-year contract extension, the team announced Wednesday. Howard, who turns 35 next week, is in his 13th season with Detroit. He could have become an unrestricted free agent after this season. The deal is worth $4 million in base salary and could add as much as $1.1 million in playoff bonuses, the Detroit Free Press reported. Howard said Tuesday night, after making 41 saves in a 3-2 win at the New York Rangers, that staying with the Red Wings "means a lot." "This is the only organization I know," Howard said on NHL.com. "I love playing for the Wings. My family loves living in Detroit. It's very special." Howard is 19-20-5 with a 3.05 goals-against average and a .908 save percentage this season. He has appeared in 509 career games (490 starts) with a 240-171-68 record, a 2.54 GAA and a .914 save percentage. He is a three-time All-Star -- 2012, 2015 and 2019. "It totally makes sense to me," Howard said on NHL.com about the one-year contract. "I'll turn 35 here in a week, and from there on out I'm fine with one-year contracts." --Field Level Media
