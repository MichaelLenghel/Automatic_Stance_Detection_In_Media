The New York Islanders recalled goaltender Christopher Gibson on Wednesday, a sign that the team will be without Robin Lehner for at least one game. Lehner left Tuesday night's 5-4 shootout win over visiting Ottawa late in the third period after getting bowled over by the Senators' Brady Tkachuk on a goal by Jean-Gabriel Pageau. Medical staff attended to Lehner, who skated off to the locker room. Lehner, who has a history of concussions, is 20-11-5 with a 2.16 goals-against average and a .928 save percentage this season. The team did not have an update on his status, as of Wednesday afternoon. Thomas Greiss is expected to start in goal for New York on Thursday night on the back end of a home-and-home series with Ottawa. Gibson, 26, has appeared in 13 NHL games in three seasons with the Islanders, including an appearance on Dec. 6. He is 3-4-3 with a 3.56 goals-against average and a .901 save percentage in the NHL. Gibson is 18-9-1 with a 3.00 GAA and .900 save percentage for Bridgeport of the AHL this season. --Field Level Media
