The Champions League could return to terrestrial television from 2021 following a six-year absence, with ITV having submitted bids for several packages ahead of Monday's deadline. UEFA have split the rights into more packages for the competition between 2021 and 2024, including selling the final as a stand-alone event for the first time, which industry experts say is an indication that they are hoping to attract several broadcast partners. BT Sport have had exclusive Champions League rights in the UK since 2015 and paid a record £1.18billion for the three-year cycle that expires at the end of next season, but they face more competition this time. Sky Sports are also understood to have bid, while the traditional broadcasters face another threat from streaming services.  Amazon Prime are not thought to be bidding as they focus on making a success of the live Premier League rights they have obtained this season, but the DAZN Group are interested in securing their first UK rights. ITV are not in the market for exclusive rights. UEFA's deadline for bids is 10.30am on Monday and an announcement could be made later that day.
