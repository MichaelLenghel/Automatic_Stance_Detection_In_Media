The Tampa Bay Lightning signed goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy, the winner of the Vezina Trophy, to an eight-year, $76 million contract extension. "Since joining the organization Andrei has shown unmatched work ethic and professionalism both on and off the ice. We look forward to him continuing his career in Tampa Bay for the foreseeable future," general manager Julien BriseBois said Monday in a statement. Vasilevskiy, 25, played in 53 games for the Lightning in the 2018-19 season and posted a 39-10-4 record. He led the NHL in wins and set a career high for save percentage (.925) to go with a goals-against average of 2.40. A two-time All-Star, he was the Lightning's first Vezina Trophy-winner as the NHL's top goaltender. "I'm very excited to sign this extension with the Lightning today," Vasilevskiy said. "I'd like to thank the entire organization ... and the great Bolts fans for making this such a great place to play and live for me and my family." Tampa Bay drafted Vasilevskiy in the first round, 19th overall, of the 2012 NHL Draft. He has played in 208 regular season games, tallying a 124-59-15 record with 18 shutouts and a 2.55 GAA and .919 save percentage. In 33 playoff games, he is 15-15 with a 2.83 GAA and .912 save percentage. --Field Level Media
