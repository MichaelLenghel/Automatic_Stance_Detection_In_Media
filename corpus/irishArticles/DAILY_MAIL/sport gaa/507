British triathlete, Lucy Charles-Barclay has battled to second place at the 2019 Ironman World Championships in Kona, Hawaii. After leading for the majority of the endurance multi-sport race, the Red Bull athlete finished the gruelling race in a time of 8 hours, 46 minutes and 44 seconds –  six minutes and 35 seconds behind eventual winner Anne Haug of Germany. Charles-Barclay jumped out to an early lead following a strong 3.86km swim that had her six seconds ahead of her closest rival and five minutes in front of the main chasing pack. The 26-year-old then put further distance between her competitors on the 180.25km bike ride, opening up a near eight-minute lead heading into the run. It was only with 10km to go that Charles-Barclay lost her lead for the first time, as Haug passed in a blistering marathon time of 2:51:06. Australia’s Sarah Crowley looked to have bumped Charles-Barclay to bronze when she passed her moments later, but the British athlete composed herself and re-passed her.
