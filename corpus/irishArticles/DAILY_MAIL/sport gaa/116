With backup goalie Ryan Miller expected to miss six weeks with a sprained knee, the Anaheim Ducks on Tuesday claimed veteran goaltender Chad Johnson off waivers from St. Louis. Miller, 38, was injured in a collision with multiple players during Sunday's win against New Jersey. Miller is 4-2-1 with a 2.72 goals-against average in 10 games this season as the backup to John Gibson. Miller needs one more win to match John Vanbiesbrouck's NHL-record of 375 victories by an American-born goalie. Johnson has appeared in 183 games with six NHL franchises since his debut in 2009-10, including a 2-6-0 record and a 3.55 GAA in 10 games with the Blues this season. St. Louis signed the 32-year-old Johnson to a $1.75 million, one-year contract in the offseason, but waived him Monday and promoted Jordan Binnington. The Ducks also announced that forward Rickard Rakell is out indefinitely with a sprained ankle. He has 20 points (five goals, 15 assists) in 30 games this season. --Field Level Media
