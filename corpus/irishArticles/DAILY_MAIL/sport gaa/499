Cristiano Ronaldo has helped transform Juventus into one of the most successful brands in world football, according to Gazzetta dello Sport.  The Portuguese star is one of the most recognisable players in the world and has established himself as a marketing supremo.  Gazzetta's financial report details how in 2018-19, Ronaldo's presence allowed the Italian side to earn €58million (£51m) extra revenue.  The club's global network of fans is also believed to have grown by 40m since Ronaldo joined the club from Real Madrid.  Ronaldo has a loyal legion of fans that have followed him to every team in his career and that has not changed since he moved to Serie A.  Juventus' Instagram page, for example, has profited immensely since Ronaldo arrived at the club with the follower account soaring above 32m.    On social media more generally, the Italian champions have closed the gap on established heavyweights Real Madrid, Barcelona and Manchester United.   Having Ronaldo in their ranks has helped in contract renewal negotiations with primary sponsors like shirt sponsor Jeep.  The car company has agreed a new deal which will see Juventus triple the money they are generating now from the agreement - in part due to the number of eyes focused on the club with Ronaldo in the black and white.
