 Madeleine Tylicki, sister of jockey Freddy, who was left paralysed in the lower half of his body following a fall at Kempton, saddled her first winner as a trainer as First To Boogie got his head in front at Punchestown on Sunday. Training since June, Tylicki, whose world was turned on its head by the injuries suffered by her brother three weeks ago in a four-horse pile-up, was all smiles after her 6-4 favourite had won under Davy Russell. Tylicki remains in St George's Hospital in Tooting and was the first on the phone to offer his congratulations following the Flynn & Lynch Life And Pensions Supporting Longford GAA Handicap Hurdle. 'It's my first winner and a very special one, obviously. It will put a smile on the family's face again, it's been a difficult time so I'm absolutely delighted,' said Tylicki. 'Today was the plan and it worked out. Luck was on our side and it was great for Freddy, it will put a smile on his face. He rang me straight away and he was absolutely delighted. 'The support and messages we've had since it happened, we're so grateful, it's very uplifting for Freddy, it's a tough time but he's a very determined young man and he's shown that in his career. 'I'm confident he'll fight through this, it's very tough. We're heading back and forth to the hospital, but we're managing.'  She added of the winner: 'He's a lovely horse. We'll take him home, freshen him up again and make a plan then. All going well he'll have a bright future. 'We've been producing horses for a number of years and we've built things up, it was a natural progression (to start training) and I got my licence in June. 'We have a nice team of horses and a lot of young ones ready for next year. We'll have some on the Flat as well.'
