DUP leader Arlene Foster held out an olive branch to nationalists today as she attended a Gaelic games match. Mrs Foster joined the crowd at the Ulster Football final between Donegal and Fermanagh in County Monaghan.  Mrs Foster, an Assembly member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, stood for the Irish national anthem. It is thought to be the first time a senior unionist politician has gone to a GAA (Gaelic Athletic Association) game since the DUP's Peter Robinson in 2012.  There has been unease at the prospect of attending GAA matches in Northern Ireland, given its historic links to nationalists. However, there are fewer concerns with today's match being played across the border in Clones in Co Monaghan.  Mrs Foster was accompanied by DUP MLA Christopher Stalford and Irish Enterprise Minister Heather Humphreys. Sinn Féin's Michelle O'Neill was also at the game - which was won by Donegal.  Mrs Foster met the Fermanagh players a week ago and gave them a good luck card which she signed 'from a proud Fermanagh woman to her neighbours'. She told journalists at the time that she was trying to reach out the hand of friendship to 'our neighbours'. 'There are a lot of my neighbours and friends who are very much GAA supporters and for them this is a huge deal to actually get to the Ulster Final because the last time was 2008,' said Mrs Foster. 'A lot of people and a lot of pundits outside of Fermanagh didn't rate their chances and the fact they have won, I just acknowledged that and said congratulations to my fellow county men.'
