Students in Leeds kicked off Halloween early last night with a boozy night out on the town, with revelers taking part in the city's famous Otley Run.  The Otley Run is known as the ultimate pub crawl with 18 stops on the way as party-goers make their way to the city centre.  Some students enjoyed the spooky celebration with scary costumes while others opted for Peaky Blinders themed outfits as they braved the rainy conditions.  The much-loved pub crawl starts at around 3pm and weaves its way from Headingley in the outskirts of Leeds along Headingley Lane, past the University of Leeds, and finishes at The Dry Dock Leeds in the city centre 1.5 miles away from the start.  Those taking part are expected to have a drink in each bar and pub they go to - spending an average of half an hour in each place - with a variety of sports bars, clubs and old taverns along the route.  Groups of students were seen dancing along the streets in their weird and wonderful outfits, with some even carrying their merry friends along with them to make it to the next stop.
