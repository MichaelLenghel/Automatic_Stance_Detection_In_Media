Colorado Avalanche goaltender Philipp Grubauer will be out indefinitely with a lower-body injury, coach Jared Bednar announced Monday. Grubauer, 28, left Saturday night's outdoor game against the Los Angeles Kings early in the third period after getting hit in the head by one of his teammates. "I don't really have a timeline on it," Bednar said. "He's still getting evaluated, he's still going through some testing or training room or whatnot. I'll have a better answer probably later in the week. Right now he's day to day and could miss some time." The game was tied 1-1 in Colorado Springs, Colo., when Grubauer was hit by defenseman Ian Cole as the latter checked Los Angeles forward Austin Wagner, who was coming in for a shot on net. Cole slid backward into Grubauer, with his rear end colliding with the goalie's head. In 36 games, Grubauer is 18-12-4 with a 2.63 goals-against average, a .916 save percentage and two shutouts. Bednar also said forward Matt Calvert, who has 12 goals and 13 assists in 50 games, has a lower-body injury and will miss a few weeks. "We're hoping it's an injury where we can get him back skating and playing here in the next couple weeks, but it's weeks, not days," Bednar said. "I'm not sure what happened, he felt it, pain in the lower body and it got worse and worse. So he's got whatever you call it, oblique strain." Pavel Francouz, who replaced Grubauer on Saturday, will start Monday night's game in goal against the Tampa Bay Lightning in Denver. Francouz is 13-5-2 with a 2.44 GAA and .925 save percentage in 22 games (18 starts). --Field Level Media
