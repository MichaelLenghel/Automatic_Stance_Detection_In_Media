The New Jersey Devils re-signed backup goaltender Eddie Lack to a one-year, $650,000 contract, the team announced Saturday. The 30-year-old Lack was acquired from the Calgary Flames in December. He went 1-2-0 with a 3.18 goals-against average in four games with the Devils and 6-7-2 with a 2.90 GAA in 16 games with Binghamton of the American Hockey League. Lack also was 1-2-0 in four games for Calgary before the trade, compiling a 5.29 GAA. Lack provides insurance as top goalie Cory Schneider recovers from hip surgery. Keith Kinkaid is expected to open the 2018-19 season as the starter. Overall, Lack has a 56-55-18 record and 2.62 GAA in 144 games over five NHL seasons. He also has played for the Vancouver Canucks and Carolina Hurricanes. --Field Level Media
