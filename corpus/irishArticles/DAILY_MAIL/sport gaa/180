The Colorado Avalanche signed Philipp Grubauer to a three-year contract on Saturday, one day after acquiring the goaltender from the Washington Capitals. Grubauer appeared in 35 games (28 starts) for the Capitals last season and went 15-10-3 with a 2.35 goals-against average. He was a backup during the postseason behind Braden Holtby as Washington won the Stanley Cup. "He just won a Stanley Cup. He's a winner, and that's always important. He knows what it takes," Avalanche general manager Joe Sakic said in a statement. "He was just in a dressing room that went through a grind. You don't win a Stanley Cup if you're not part of a close team that believes and knows how to win in the playoffs. And he had a huge part in getting them into the playoffs. "He's had two really good years in a backup role, and we all feel he's ready to take the next step and become a No. 1. We're excited to have two No. 1 goalies." Grubauer is expected to challenge Semyon Varlamov for the starting job. Varlamov went 24-16-6 with a 2.68 GAA in 51 games (47 starts) last season before suffering a season-ending knee injury. Overall, the German-born Grubauer is 43-31-11 with a 2.29 GAA and six shutouts in 101 games (79 starts) over six NHL seasons. The Avalanche sent a second-round pick to the Capitals in Friday's draft-night trade for Grubauer and defenseman Brooks Orpik. --Field Level Media
