Chicago Blackhawks goaltender Corey Crawford was on the ice working out with teammates and coaches Saturday, his first reported action since suffering a concussion five weeks ago. Video clips posted on social media by the Blackhawks and The Athletic showed the 34-year-old veteran practicing with goaltending coach Jimmy Waite and goalies Cam Ward and Collin Delia. Crawford suffered a concussion, his second in the past year, during a first-period collision against the San Jose Sharks on Dec. 16. He was knocked over backward and his head struck the post. The two-time Stanley Cup winner missed 47 games last season with concussion-related symptoms. Chicago is in no rush to remove Crawford from the injured reserve list, as the Blackhawks (16-24-9) have the worst record in the NHL. Crawford is 6-14-2 with a 3.21 goals-against average and .902 save percentage in 2018-19, his 12th season with Chicago. He ranks third in franchise history in wins (236), saves (11,175) and GAA (2.42). --Field Level Media
