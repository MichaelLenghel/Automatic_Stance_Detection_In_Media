Rebecca Judd knows all the ins and outs of AFL thanks to her marriage to former Carlton captain Chris Judd. And she offered a glimpse into the strict lifestyle of an elite footy star on Monday, when she revealed the league's secret list of 'banned' activities for players. Speaking on her KIIS FM radio show, The 3pm Pick Up, Rebecca said that no-go sports include skiing, snowboarding, skydiving and even mixed netball. She revealed the list during a discussion about the time she went skydiving with Chris when they first started dating. 'For some reason, either him or me, had this silly idea to go skydiving. But he wasn't even allowed in his contract!' she said. 'He was playing for the West Coast Eagles at the time.' Surprised by the revelation, Rebecca's co-host, Katie 'Monty' Dimond, asked: 'Are AFL players not allowed to do things like that?' 'No, no,' she replied. 'No skiing, no snowboarding, no skydiving.' 'What if they wanted to be in a mixed netball team? Are they allowed to do that?' Monty then asked. 'No. They're not supposed to,' Rebecca replied. But Rebecca revealed that some AFL players break the rules when it comes to activities like snowboarding and skiing. 'A lot of football players will sneak off to a ski field on the weekend,' she said. 'In October, in the off season, we used to go to Queenstown and ski.'  Chris served as the captain for both the West Coast Eagles and Carlton before announcing his retirement in 2015 after 279 games.
