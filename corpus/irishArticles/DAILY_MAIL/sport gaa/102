Toronto Maple Leafs goalkeeper Frederik Andersen will be back in the net for Monday's home game against the Colorado Avalanche. Andersen has been sidelined since suffering a groin injury on Dec. 22. "I've been working hard on making sure it feels well and feels good to play on, and is something that won't linger," Andersen told reporters after Monday's morning skate. "That's why we took a little bit extra time to make sure I was feeling great. "If I really had to play I could have pushed it a little bit sooner, but we tested our patience a little bit in trying to get it fixed." Maple Leafs coach Mike Babcock officially declared Andersen the starter after the skating session. "Freddie is our guy," Babcock told reporters. "The doctors and trainers were real careful to make sure. He's an important part of the team. He's had a good rest and good time off ... they say he's ready to go, so he gets his opportunity here today." Andersen, 29, was 20-9-1 with a 2.50 goals-against average and .923 save percentage before he was injured in a game against the New York Rangers. Andersen has a career mark of 168-72-32 with a 2.54 GAA and .918 save percentage over six NHL seasons with the Anaheim Ducks (2013-16) and Maple Leafs. Toronto backup goalie Garret Sparks also is back with the team. He has been in the NHL concussion protocol since taking a puck off the mask during a practice on Jan. 2. Sparks is 6-2-1 with a 3.00 GAA and .905 save percentage in 10 appearances (nine starts). Michael Hutchinson served as the goalie for the past five games and went 2-3 with a 2.64 GAA and .914 save percentage. Overall, Hutchinson is 3-4 with a 3.27 GAA and .887 save percentage in nine games (eight starts) for Toronto and Florida this season. The Maple Leafs acquired Hutchinson from the Panthers in late December in exchange for a 2020 fifth-round draft pick. --Field Level Media
