The Washington Capitals will start goaltender Philipp Grubauer instead of former Vezina Trophy-winner Braden Holtby in Game 1 against the Columbus Blue Jackets on Thursday. Grubauer, 26, started 10 of the team's final 16 regular-season games and won seven of them, allowing 2.32 goals per game with a save percentage of .925. For the season, he went 15-10-3 with a 2.35 goals-against average and a .923 save percentage. "It's a privilege to start for sure, but it's just like any other game," Grubauer told reporters on Tuesday. "We treat it as Game 1 or Game 82. It's not going to change any of my approach." Holtby, who was named the league's top goaltender two years ago, has struggled down the stretch, going 8-7-2 with a 3.35 goals-against average and .886 save percentage over his final 17 games. The 28-year-old was pulled three times in a six-game span bridging February and March and also battled a minor lower-body injury in March. He finished at 34-16-4 with a 2.99 goals-against average and a .907 save percentage in the regular season. "My job is just to focus on my game, getting it the best I can get to," Holtby told reporters. "It's coach's decision who plays or not. This doesn't have anything to do with me. So focus on one practice at a time, try to be a positive influence around the team and go from there." Despite Washington's inability to get over the playoff hump in recent years, Holtby has historically performed better in the playoffs (2.00 GAA, .932 save percentage) than in the regular season (2.41 GAA, .919 save percentage). In his sixth year with the Capitals, Grubauer has made just two career playoff appearances, winning his lone start in 2015 by stopping 18 of 21 shot attempts. He also relieved Holtby in a loss to the Penguins last year, making seven saves on nine shots. --Field Level Media
