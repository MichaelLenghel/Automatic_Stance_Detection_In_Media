Unai Emery appeared in no mood to talk ahead of Arsenal's Europa League clash with Vittoria on Wednesday afternoon. The embattled Gunners boss gave short shrift to questions in his pre-match interview on BT Sport ahead of kick-off in Portugal. When asked to explain his decision to captain Rob Holding, in the wake of removing Granit Xhaka from the role, Emery could only respond: 'Why? Because he is.' Even when prompted to talk up 18-year-old sensation Gabriel Martinelli, who has scored seven times in seven games, he offered: 'He's young but he's working very well.' He was asked what he liked about the Brazilian, and replied: 'I think you can look at him and his quality'. It has been a testing week for Emery after the fallout of Xhaka's feud with Arsenal fans as he left the pitch in the 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace at the end of last month. Matters were not helped by a lacklustre home draw with Wolves on Saturday.  Question: In Rob you have another captain from the start of a match, how distracting has the issue of the captain's role been and what's happened with Granit in the last week or so? Unai Emery: Today it's Rob Holding and he's perfect. Q: Why? UE: Because I think. Why? Because he is. Q: In terms of your other selections you've got Martinelli who plays through the middle from the start. Why's he been able to start his career with Arsenal so strongly yet he's so young? UE: He's young but he's working very well. Q: What do you like about him? UE: I think you can look at him and his quality. Q: Good luck tonight. UE: Thank you.
