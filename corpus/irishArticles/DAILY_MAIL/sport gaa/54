Shane Lowry’s father has hailed his son’s Open Championship victory as the best birthday present he has ever given him. Brendan Lowry, a celebrated Gaelic footballer, turned 60 days before Shane clinched the Claret Jug in famous scenes at Royal Portrush. Mr Lowry said his own all-Ireland GAA crown, won with Co Offaly in 1982, paled in comparison with his son’s triumph at the Open’s historic return to the island of Ireland.

His father described the scenes as thousands of fans charged down the fairway to savour the moment as “mayhem” and “absolutely mental”.

That’s what he said, everybody was crying. “That’s what he dreamed about, like any young sportsman when they take it up they dream of things like that. “What about winning the British Open in Ireland – you can’t dream it, and in Portrush, which he likes too.” As his son fulfilled his media duties, Mr Lowry’s mind was already turning to the celebrations. “I’m going off to get a bottle of Heineken, that’s where I am going,” he said.
