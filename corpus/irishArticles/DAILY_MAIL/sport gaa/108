MONTREAL (AP) - Montreal goalie Carey Price will miss the Canadiens' three-game trip because of a lower-body injury. The Canadiens said Thursday that Price will not travel to Florida. The Canadiens play the Panthers on Friday night, are at NHL-leading Tampa Bay on Saturday night, and at Dallas on Monday night. Price is 15-10-4 with a 2.84 goals-against average in 30 games this season. The Canadiens will likely look to Antti Niemi on the trip. He's 4-3-1 with a 4.14 GAA. ___ More AP NHL: https://apnews.com/tag/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
