The Carolina Hurricanes placed goaltender Scott Darling on waivers, the team announced Thursday. Darling allowed four goals on just 19 shots during Saturday's loss to the New York Islanders in his final appearance. Darling, 29, was 2-4-1 with a 3.14 goals-against average and .892 save percentage in seven games. Darling is in the second season of a four-year, $16.6 million deal. Overall, Darling is 54-42-17 with a 2.70 GAA and .909 save percentage over five NHL seasons. He spent his first three campaigns with the Chicago Blackhawks before being traded to the Hurricanes. Darling was 13-21-7 with a 3.18 GAA and .888 save percentage last season. Carolina also waived 23-year-old forward Valentin Zykov, who has three assists in 13 games this season. --Field Level Media
