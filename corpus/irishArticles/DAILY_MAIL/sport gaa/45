Sean Cox, the Irishman who suffered severe injuries in an unprovoked attack in Liverpool last April, will begin rehabilitation in England next week. Mr Cox, a 54-year-old father of three from Dunboyne, Co Meath was injured before the 2018 Champions League semi-final at Anfield. Three men are currently serving separate jail sentences for the attack. After almost 18 months of treatment in Ireland, Mr Cox is being transported to a specialist neurological facility in the north of England for an initial 12-week rehabilitation programme focused on developing his speech and movement.

Mr Cox and his family will return to Anfield to watch a Liverpool match in October. The Support Sean campaign will host a show in January 2020 in the Three Arena, Dublin in order to raise funds for his future care.
