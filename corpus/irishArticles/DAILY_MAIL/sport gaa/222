Pittsburgh Penguins goalie Matt Murray has been diagnosed with a concussion after getting hit in the head by a puck in practice Monday, Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said. Tristan Jarry has been recalled from the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins of the American Hockey League on an emergency basis with Murray out. Jarry had been reassigned to the AHL by the Penguins on Monday night. Murray left Monday's practice early after being hit by an Olli Maatta shot. The 23-year-old is 23-13-2 this season with a 2.82 goals-against average and .909 save percentage. He's 9-1-1 in his last 11 appearances. With Murray out, Casey DeSmith and Jarry will serve as the team's goaltenders. DeSmith, recalled from the AHL on Monday, is 3-3-0 with a 2.24 GAA and .926 save percentage in seven games this season.
