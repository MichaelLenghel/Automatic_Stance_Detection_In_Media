AGE 38  In 2003, the TV presenter sported a shorter cut and choppy fringe — which is messy, uneven in the middle and makes her face look rounder.  The darker shade of her hair, combined with the lack of eye make-up and deep pink lips, wash her out. AGE 55  The Question Time host appears radiant, with glowing skin and toned down, taupe shades of make-up.  Her hair is now much softer, too, with honey-blonde highlights that brighten her whole look. The longer cut also flatters her face shape.
