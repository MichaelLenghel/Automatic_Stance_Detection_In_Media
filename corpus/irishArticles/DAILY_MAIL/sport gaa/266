All-Ireland quarter-finalists Fermanagh made a winning start to the new season, but were still left in the shade on a historic night in Garvaghey. Cavan referee Maggie Farrelly became the first woman to take charge of a men’s adult senior inter-county game in the 132-year history of the GAA and left her mark in the 52nd minute when she sent off St Mary’s full-forward Matthew Fitzpatrick for a second cautionable offence. It proved to be the game’s defining moment as St Mary’s, for whom Down star Kevin McKernan excelled in the second half by kicking three points from wing-back, ceded a five-point lead after they had moved 0-11 to 0-6 ahead at the start of the second half. Sean Quigley’s arrival off the bench in the third quarter saw the Fermanagh sharpshooter fire over four points. It allowed Fermanagh to draw level (0-12 to 0-12) and they hit the front eight minutes from the end when wing-back Ciaran Flaherty was at the end of a flowing move to fire to the back of the net to ensure his side bagged the two McKenna Cup points on offer.
