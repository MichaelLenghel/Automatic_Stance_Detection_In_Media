LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) - The Court of Arbitration for Sport says it has registered an appeal by track coach Alberto Salazar against his ban for doping violations, though a hearing will take several months to prepare. CAS says Salazar and Dr. Jeffrey Brown appealed against their four-year bans by the United States Anti-Doping Agency. After a multi-year USADA investigation, Salazar and Brown were found guilty of doping violations linked to the Nike Oregon Project training camp. USADA said Salazar ran experiments with supplements and testosterone, and possessed and trafficked the banned substance. The case also related to falsified and incomplete medical records that disguised the work. CAS says Salazar and Brown asked for more time to file "written submissions and evidence," adding the hearing is "unlikely to take place before March." Verdicts typically take at least a further several weeks. FILE - In this June 28, 2015, file photo, Alberto Salazar is shown at the U.S. track and field championships in Eugene, Ore.
