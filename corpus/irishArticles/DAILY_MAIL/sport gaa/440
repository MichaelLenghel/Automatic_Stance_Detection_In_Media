Juventus have entered the race for Salzburg starlet Erling Braut Haaland, according to reports in Italy. The Norwegian striker has scored an astonishing 22 goals already this season and would fetch at least £35m, according to Gazzetta dello Sport. They add that agent Mino Raiola, believed to be advising the 19-year-old, is trying to engineer a big-money move. Juventus are just the latest European giant to monitor the teenager's progress, with Manchester United and Real Madrid also believed to be interested. His record both in Austria and Europe has set pulses racing across the continent.  Haaland, son of former Manchester City midifelder Alf-Inge, has scored six times in this season's Champions League, including in the 4-3 defeat at Liverpool earlier this month.
