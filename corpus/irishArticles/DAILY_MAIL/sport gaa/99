The Minnesota Wild agreed to a three-year, $2.355 contract extension with backup goaltender Alex Stalock on Tuesday, the team announced. Stalock will make $905,000 in 2019-20, $700,000 in 2020-21 and $750,000 in 2021-22, according to the Wild. Stalock, 31, is 6-5-0 with the Wild this season, recording a 2.91 goals-against average, with an .894 save percentage in 14 games (10 starts) as the backup to Devan Dubnyk, who is 20-16-3 with a 2.57 GAA in 41 appearances (40 starts). Stalock, a native of St. Paul, Minn., played in his 100th career game on Dec. 6 at Calgary, becoming the seventh Minnesota-born goalie to reach that milestone. The former fourth-round draft pick by the San Jose Sharks in 2005 is 17-16-4 with a 2.80 GAA in 44 games (35 starts) with the Wild in his career. He was signed by Minnesota as a free agent in 2016 and then agreed to a two-year deal in 2017. Stalock played parts of five seasons with San Jose. --Field Level Media
