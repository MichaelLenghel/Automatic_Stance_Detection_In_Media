Sport Australia is refusing to reveal how many grant recommendations were scrapped for captain's calls made by former sports minister Bridget McKenzie. The $100 million Community Sport Infrastructure grants program is being investigated by the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO), with Senator McKenzie's home state of Victoria receiving a quarter of the funding. Senator McKenzie, the Nationals deputy leader, rejected 618 applications recommended for funding but approved an undisclosed amount not endorsed by Sport Australia. There were 684 projects approved from more than 2000 applications, but Victoria received more funding than any other state in a scheme dubbed "dodgy" by Labor. The program first came under scrutiny when Liberal candidate Georgina Downer, the daughter of former foreign minister Alexander Downer, was embroiled in a scandal in February. In the lead up to the May election, Ms Downer presented a novelty cheque for $127,000 to a South Australian bowling club instead of local MP Rebekha Sharkie. It prompted the ANAO to examine whether applications were assessed within the guidelines, with a report due next month. Sport Australia chief executive Kate Palmer admitted at a committee hearing on Wednesday some grants may not have been recommended by her government agency. A Sport Australia spokesperson said on Friday with the scheme the subject of a performance audit it was "not appropriate" to comment further. It ends a tumultuous week for Senator McKenzie whose Nationals leadership position was thrown into question following rumblings within her party room.
