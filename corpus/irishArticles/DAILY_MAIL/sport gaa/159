The Winnipeg Jets announced the signing of goalie Connor Hellebuyck to a six-year, $37 million deal Thursday. Hellebuyck had filed for salary arbitration last week after being tendered a qualifying offer by the Jets in June. Hellebuyck, 25, enjoyed a breakout 2017-18 season that saw him tie for the NHL lead in wins at 44-11-9. He had a 2.36 goals-against average and .924 save percentage in 67 games (64 starts) and was named a finalist for the Vezina Trophy awarded to the league's top goaltender. Hellebuyck continued his success into the postseason, where he had a 2.36 GAA and .922 save percentage in 17 games before the Jets fell to the Vegas Golden Knights in the Western Conference finals. Hellebuyck, a fifth-round pick in the 2012 NHL Draft, became the Jets' primary starting goalie in 2016-17, his second season in the league. He is 83-41-14 with a 2.55 GAA and .917 save percentage for his career. --Field Level Media
