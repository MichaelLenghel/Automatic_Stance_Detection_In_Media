The Pittsburgh Penguins reached a two-year deal with promising young backup goalie Tristan Jarry on Thursday. The deal averages $675,000 and is a two-way contract in the first season and a one-way contract in the second. Jarry, 23, was 14-6-2 with a 2.77 GAA as Matt Murray's backup last season. He didn't play at all during the Penguins' playoff run. Jarry, who was a restricted free agent, was taken by the Penguins in the second round of the 2013 NHL Entry Draft, 44th overall. --Field Level Media
