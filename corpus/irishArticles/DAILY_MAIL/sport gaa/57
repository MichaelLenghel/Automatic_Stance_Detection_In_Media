The Vegas Golden Knights avoided arbitration with Malcolm Subban, signing the goaltender to a one-year, $850,000 contract Tuesday. Subban appeared in 21 games (20 starts) for Vegas last season, with an 8-10-2 record, a 2.93 goals-against average and a .902 save percentage. "(Malcolm has) been a valuable contributor to our team over the last two seasons," general manager George McPhee said on NHL.com. "We are excited to continue to work with Malcolm and help him reach his full potential as an NHL goaltender." Subban, 25, again will be an arbitration-eligible restricted free agent after next season. Subban, claimed off waivers from the Boston Bruins in October 2017, was 13-4-2 in the 2017-18 season with a 2.68 GAA and a .910 save percentage, helping the Golden Knights reach the Stanley Cup Final. He was a first-round pick in the 2012 NHL Draft, selected No. 24 overall by the Bruins. He started in both of his appearances for Boston, posting an 0-2 mark. --Field Level Media
