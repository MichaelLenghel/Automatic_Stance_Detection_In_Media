Tampa Bay Lightning goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy still needs a few more weeks of recovery time from a fractured left foot before he can return to the ice, coach Jon Cooper said Thursday, per NHL.com "When he gets skating here soon we'll know a little bit more, but in the end even when he does get on the ice there's still a long process after that," Cooper said. "So we're just inching our way closer." Vasilevskiy broke his foot Nov. 14 during a practice and has missed 11 games. He was expected to be out four to six weeks. The 24-year-old Vasilevskiy is 9-3-1 with a 2.30 goals-against average and .927 save percentage in 13 games this season. Vasilevskiy was a finalist for the Vezina Trophy as the league's top goalkeeper last season when he went 44-17-3 with a 2.62 GAA and .920 save percentage. He tied for the league high in victories and in shutouts (eight). Backup goalie Louis Domingue has posted an 11-4-0 record with a .900 save percentage and has won eight of 10 starts since assuming the starting role. Cooper also said Thursday that the team still is waiting for defenseman Anton Stralman to have his upper-body injury re-evaluated. He has missed the past 13 games. --Field Level Media
