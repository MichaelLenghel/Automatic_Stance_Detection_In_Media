Anna Faris and her rumored fiancé Michael Barrett stepped out to enjoy the sunshine while out and about in Pacific Palisades on Sunday afternoon.   The two were joined by Anna's son Jack (whom she shares with her ex Chris Pratt) and her giant new accessory on her ring finger. Both Anna, 42, and Michael's, 49, behavior has recently been fueling engagement rumors but neither have confirmed nor denied the news.  For the family fun day, the House Bunny star wore an oversized yellow t-shirt and a pair of yellow shorts. She had a hat on and a pair of aviator sunglasses while walking with her family. Michael kept it casual in just jeans and a t-shirt and at one point held hands with Jack as they walked. Just a week or so before this, E! News sources claim that when photographers caught up with the stars they told them that they were doing 'wonderful.' But when asked about their 'big day' they politely declined to speak about the potential engagement. The two have been dating for about two years after meeting on-set of their movie Overboard.  Anna was previously married to Guardians of the Galaxy star Chris Pratt. The two met back in 2007 and later got engaged that same year. Shortly after, Chris began to film for his new television show Parks and Recreation which shot him to fame. And later that year in July, the two tie the knot in a beautiful ceremony in Bali. In 2012, they welcomed their son Jack and Chris begins to work on his two new movies Jurassic World and Guardians of the Galaxy. And sadly, in August of 2017, they announced they were separating as a couple.  As part of their divorce settlement, the two agree to live within five miles of one another for the next five years for the sake of their son, according to TMZ.
