Sport Australia is on the lookout for a new chief executive after Kate Palmer announced she will step aside when her contract expires on January 31. Palmer has been in the role since February 2017 after joining from Netball Australia. Sport Australia is the nation's peak sporting body and is in charge of funding elite sports in the country and promoting physical activity. The organisation plays a key role in laying the foundations that can lead to future Olympic success. "Kate has led an ongoing process of building capability and of governance reform among national sports organisations and put in place important safeguards to protect children in sporting environments," chairman John Wylie said. "She has also worked with the CEO of the Australian Institute of Sport, Peter Conde, to establish the AIS as a more focused organisation as it prepares Australian elite talent for the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics next year." Sport Australia will appoint an acting chief executive until the position is filled permanently. "I believe in, and am pleased with, the progress we have made in helping Australians to become more active, in improving the physical literacy of children, and driving governance and management improvement across sport," Palmer said. "Highlights have been initiating the AIS site project and leading it to a mature point and playing a role in setting the course for Sport Integrity Australia and the National Sports Tribunal. "Both are critical to the future of Australia's leading role in fair and clean sport."
