The New Jersey Devils waived veteran goaltender Cory Schneider. If Schneider, 33, clears waivers on Tuesday, he will be assigned to Binghamton of the American Hockey League. Schneider, in his seventh season with New Jersey, has struggled to start the season. In six games, he's 0-4-1 with a 4.59 goals-against average and .852 save percentage. MacKenzie Blackwood, 22, now becomes the unquestioned No. 1 goalie. "We addressed it with our players, and unfortunately this is part of the business, but this isn't the end of the road with Cory," coach John Hynes told reporters after Schneider's release. "It's an opportunity for us to try and help him get his game to where it needs to be. We had a similar situation with him last year where it worked out really well where he went down to Binghamton and played, got some footing for himself and his game back and came back and played well for us later in the year." Schneider last played on Nov. 8 in a loss to the Edmonton Oilers. He allowed four goals on 32 shots in the 4-0 defeat. "Mackenzie has been consistent and he's played well and been able to manage himself and mange his workload," Hynes said of Blackwood. "That was part of the decision-making process. It wasn't the complete part of the decision, but it was a small part." In 14 games this season, Blackwood is 7-4-3 with a 2.79 GAA and .904 save percentage. Schneider started his career with the Vancouver Canucks, who selected him with the No. 26 pick in the 2004 NHL Draft. New Jersey acquired him in a June 30, 2013, trade with the Canucks. In his career, Schneider has a 167-157-57 with a 2.43 GAA and a .918 save percentage. To take Schneider's spot on the roster, the Devils recalled goalie Louis Domingue from Binghamton. --Field Level Media
