Tampa Bay Lighting star goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy will be back on the ice for Thursday night's game against the Toronto Maple Leafs after missing 14 games with a fractured left foot. Lightning coach Jon Cooper revealed the news to reporters at Thursday's morning skate. "The type of injury he had is not a lingering type thing," Cooper said. "It had to heal and once it heals, it's good." The 24-year-old Vasilevskiy was 9-3-1 with a 2.30 goals-against average and .927 save percentage this season prior to suffering the foot injury during a practice on Nov. 14. Vasilevskiy was a finalist for the Vezina Trophy as the league's top goalkeeper last season when he went 44-17-3 with a 2.62 GAA and .920 save percentage. He tied for the league high in victories and in shutouts (eight). "He's been our MVP for a long time here on this team," Lightning captain Steven Stamkos told reporters on Thursday. "I know it was tough for him to watch all those games, but Louis (Domingue) stepped up and the guys played great in front of him, as well. "We can't have that letdown now, obviously because he's an elite goaltender, but we want to maintain the play that we've had." Domingue went 11-2-0 during Vasilevskiy's absence and Edward Pasquale won his lone start. "It's a team sport and the reason you've got guys in line waiting to play is in case injuries happen," Cooper said. "You don't want anybody get to hurt, ever, but you can lose your starting goaltender for a month or so. That's 15 or 16 games. Somebody's got to fill that void and step in and Louis has done an unreal job." Pasquale was reassigned to Syracuse of the American Hockey League earlier this week. The Lighting have won seven straight games and own a solid 24-7-1 record as well as a league-leading 49 points. --Field Level Media
