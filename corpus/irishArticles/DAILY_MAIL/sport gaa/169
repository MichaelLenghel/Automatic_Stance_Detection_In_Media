The St. Louis Blues have brought forward David Perron back for a third stint with the club as he signed a four-year, $16 million deal on Sunday, the first day of the NHL free-agency period. Perron's second stint ended when he was selected by the Vegas Golden Knights in last summer's expansion draft. St. Louis also signed center Tyler Bozak to a three-year, $15 million contract, and goalkeeper Chad Johnson to a one-year, $1.75 million deal. The 30-year-old Perron scored 16 goals in 70 regular-season games with the Golden Knights last season and recorded career-bests for assists (50) and points (66). He contributed one goal and eight assists during the team's playoff run. "We really didn't want to lose him a year ago in expansion," Blues general manager Doug Armstrong said of Perron. "They took David and it ended up being a very good pickup for them. He had a great year. "He's a 45, 50-point guy that you can rely on. He's only 30 ... so we're not getting into those questionable years with David. We're excited to have him back." Perron spent his first six seasons (2007-13) with the Blues. He spent time with the Edmonton Oilers, Pittsburgh Penguins and Anaheim Ducks before returning to St. Louis in 2016. Perron has 175 goals and 269 assists (444 points) in 722 career regular-season games. The 32-year-old Bozak spent all nine seasons of his career with the Toronto Maple Leafs prior to Sunday's signing. He has 136 goals and 229 assists (365 points) in 594 regular-season games. Bozak had 11 goals and 32 assists (43 points) in 81 games last season. He had a career-best 55 points the previous campaign. Johnson, 32, went 10-16-3 with a 3.55 goals-against average and .891 save percentage in 36 games (29 starts) for the Buffalo Sabres last season. He has started 105 games over the past three seasons -- two spent with the Sabres and a stint with the Calgary Flames in between. Johnson has a career regular-season mark of 78-61-15 with a 2.65 GAA and .910 save percentage in 173 games (153 starts). --Field Level Media
