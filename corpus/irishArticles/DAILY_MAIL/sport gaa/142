Roberto Luongo has logged barely a half hour of ice time, but the veteran's 19th NHL season is on hold, perhaps for a month. Florida Panthers coach Bob Boughner announced Monday the 39-year-old goaltender will miss two to four weeks with a Grade 1 strain of the MCL in his knee. The Panthers placed Luongo on injured reserve Sunday. He was injured in the club's season opener on Saturday, a 2-1 shootout victory by the host Tampa Bay Lightning. With the Panthers up 1-0, Florida teammates Mark Pysyk and Frank Vatrano collided in front of the net 12:21 into the second period, knocking Vatrano onto Luongo's right leg. Luongo made 13 saves before the injury. James Reimer replaced him. The Panthers don't play again until their home opener against Columbus on Thursday night, and Reimer is expected to start. "In (Luongo's) absence, it's just win some hockey games," Reimer told the media. "That's what we train for all summer to do." The team also recalled goalie Michael Hutchinson from Springfield of the American Hockey League on an emergency basis Monday. Luongo is 471-376-119 with a 2.49 goals-against average in his career. He was 18-11-2 in 35 games (33 starts) with a 2.47 GAA last season, his fifth in his second stint with Florida. --Field Level Media
