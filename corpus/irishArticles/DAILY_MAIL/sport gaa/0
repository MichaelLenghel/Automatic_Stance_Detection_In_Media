The Chicago Blackhawks were very busy with last-hour deals before Monday's NHL trade deadline, sending goaltender Robin Lehner to Las Vegas, defenseman Erik Gustafsson to Calgary and prospect Nathan Noel to Philadelphia. An hour after the trade deadline passed, Lehner sent out a pair of tweets: one thanking Chicago and the other saying he is "really excited to join Vegas." The Golden Knights later confirmed the deal, which also sees forward Martins Dzierkals go to Vegas and the Blackhawks get goalie Malcolm Subban (a pending restricted free agent), defenseman prospect Slava Demin and a second-round pick. Lehner signed a one-year, $5 million contract with Chicago in July. He has posted a 16-10-5 record with a 3.01 goals-against average and .918 save percentage in 33 appearances (31 starts) this season. The 28-year-old Swede enjoyed a career season with the New York Islanders in 2018-19, finishing as a Vezina Trophy finalist while winning the William M. Jennings Trophy and the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy. Lehner owned a 25-13-5 mark with a career-best six shutouts, a 2.13 goals-against average and .930 save percentage. Lehner has posted a 113-120-45 career record with 14 shutouts, a 2.73 goals-against average and .918 save percentage in 298 appearances (279 starts) with the Ottawa Senators, Buffalo Sabres, Islanders and Blackhawks. Subban, 26, is 9-7-3 with a 3.18 GAA and .890 save percentage in 20 games this season. The younger brother of star Devils defenseman P.K. Subban, Malcolm is 30-23-7 in 65 career games with a 2.97 GAA and .899 save percentage. Chicago confirmed they sent Gustafsson, 27, to the Flames for a third-round pick. Gustafsson has six goals and 20 assists in 59 games this season, after going for 17 and 43 for 60 points (all career highs) last season. He has 116 points (28 goals, 88 assists) in four seasons with Chicago, which selected him in the fourth round (No. 93 overall) in 2012. In exchange for Noel, a 22-year-old center who registered 17 points (six goals, 11 assists) in 47 games between Indy of the ECHL and Rockford of the AHL, the Blackhawks announced they received defenseman T.J. Brennan from the Flyers. The Blackhawks are sending the 30-year-old Brennan to Rockford. A second-round pick by Buffalo in 2007, Brennan has not played in the NHL since registering a goal and six penalty minutes in seven games with Toronto in 2015-16. He has five goals, eight assists and 29 penalty minutes in 53 career NHL games with Buffalo, Florida and Toronto. --Field Level Media
