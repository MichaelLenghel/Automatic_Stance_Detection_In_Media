The Philadelphia Flyers hope they have shored up their goalie situation at last by acquiring veteran Cam Talbot from the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for netminder Anthony Stolarz late Friday. Talbot, 31, will back up rookie Carter Hart for the Flyers, who have played seven goalies already this season. "Me and 'Talbs' skated together all summer,'" Hart said of offseason workouts they shared, per The Morning Call. "We really got along. This past summer we partnered up. He's a great mentor, great goalie." Talbot went 10-15-3 with a 3.36 GAA for the Oilers this season, his sixth in the league. For his career, Talbot is 137-110-24 with a 2.59 GAA in 284 games. Hart, 20, is 11-6-1 with a 2.48 GAA in his first NHL season and just came off an eight-game win streak. Talbot's $4.2 million salary made him expendable for the cost-cutting Oilers. Stolarz played just 19 games for the Flyers since they made him a second-round pick in 2012, going 6-4-4 with a 2.86 GAA in his limited action. He's also undergone two knee surgeries in the past 18 months and will be a restricted free agent after the season. --Field Level Media
