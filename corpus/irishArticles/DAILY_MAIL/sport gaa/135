The Chicago Blackhawks placed goaltender Anton Forsberg on waivers Monday, according to multiple reports. Forsberg, 25, has not played this season as he sits third on the depth chart behind veterans Corey Crawford and Cam Ward. If he clears waivers, he could head to the Rockford IceHogs of the AHL or another minor-league destination. The Blackhawks leaned heavily on Forsberg last season, but he did not show enough consistency to win the battle for the No. 2 goaltending job before this season. Forsberg went 10-16-4 with a .908 save percentage and 2.97 goals-against average in 35 games (30 starts) last season. In 45 career games (39 starts), Forsberg is 11-24-4 with a .901 save percentage and 3.21 GAA. Chicago acquired Forsberg and Brandon Saad from the Columbus Blue Jackets before the start of the 2017-18 season in exchange for playmaking forward Artemi Panarin and Tyler Motte. The Blackhawks would prefer to keep him in the organization in case Crawford or Ward get hurt. --Field Level Media
