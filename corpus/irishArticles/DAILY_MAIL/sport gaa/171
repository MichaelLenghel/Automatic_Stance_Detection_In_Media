As NHL teams brace for free agency, the Minnesota Wild have placed forward Tyler Ennis on buyout waivers, according to reports. The Montreal Canadiens also reportedly did the same with goalie Steve Mason, who they acquired earlier in the day in a trade with the Winnipeg Jets. Mason, 30, went 5-6-1 and posted a 3.24 goals-against average last season. He's started 458 career games and was named the league's top rookie with the Columbus Blue Jackets in 2009. He's 205-183-64 with a 2.70 GAA in 476 career games. The Canadiens will save about $1.4 million over two seasons by waiving Mason. Ennis, 28, was set to make $3.65 million next season, but the Wild will save about $2.4 million with the move. He had eight goals and 14 assists in 73 games last season, his first with the Wild after eight years in Buffalo. --Field Level Media
