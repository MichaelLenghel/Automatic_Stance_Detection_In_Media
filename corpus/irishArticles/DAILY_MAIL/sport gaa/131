Los Angeles Kings goaltender Jonathan Quick is out indefinitely after having surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his knee, the team announced Wednesday. Quick was placed on injured reserve Sunday and deemed day-to-day with a lower-body injury, which was not believed to be related to a lower-body injury that caused Quick to miss five games earlier in October. It's unclear when Quick was injured, as he played the whole game in his last action last Tuesday. "Injuries do happen and not sure there's anything in particular you can point to in this situation," head coach John Stevens said after Tuesday's practice. "I think he's done a good job of really staying on top of everything, his preventative maintenance, his daily routines, so these things happen sometimes and you have to deal with them." Quick, 32, is 0-3-1 with a 4.55 goals-against average and .845 save percentage in four games this season. He went 0-3 in three starts after returning from his previous injury, allowing 14 goals on 77 shots (.818 save percentage). The Kings previously called up Peter Budaj from the AHL's Ontario Reign, though he has yet to play since returning to the team. Jack Campbell has started all seven games in which Quick has been absent this year, including the last two. He is 3-4-0 with a 2.72 GAA and .912 save percentage, as the Kings sit at 3-7-1. --Field Level Media
