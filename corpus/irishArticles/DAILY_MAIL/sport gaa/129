Los Angeles Kings goaltender Jack Campbell needs knee surgery will miss approximately four to six weeks, the team announced Monday. Campbell will have surgery to repair a torn meniscus. He was injured during Saturday's game against the Calgary Flames. Campbell has been the Kings' main starter while star goalie Jonathan Quick recovers from his own meniscus surgery. Quick was injured in late October and is out indefinitely. The 26-year-old Campbell is 5-7-0 with a 2.33 goals-against average and .923 save percentage in 13 appearances (12 starts) this season. Los Angeles recalled goalie Cal Peterson from the Ontario Reign of the American Hockey League. Peterson, 24, is 2-3-1 with a 4.29 GAA in 10 games at Ontario. The Kings optioned forward Matt Luff to the Reign. Luff didn't score a point in three games with Los Angeles. The Kings also have goalie Peter Budaj on the roster. The 36-year-old allowed one goal in 29:59 of relief in his lone appearance this season. Quick, 32, was 0-3-1 with a 4.55 goals-against average and .845 save percentage in four games this season prior to the injury. Los Angeles hosts the Toronto Maple Leafs on Tuesday. --Field Level Media
