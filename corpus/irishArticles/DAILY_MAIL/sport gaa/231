New York Rangers backup goaltender Ondrej Pavelec will be out two to three weeks with a sprained MCL, the team announced Sunday. Pavelec started Friday night's game against the Calgary Flames but left after the first period of a 4-3 win with the knee injury. He gave up one goal and made seven saves before exiting the game. The 30-year-old Pavelec is 4-7-1 with a 3.01 goals-against average and a .910 save percentage in 16 games (10 starts) in his first season with the Rangers. He made 379 appearances over 10 seasons with the Atlanta/Winnipeg franchise. Goalie Alexandar Georgiev was recalled from Hartford of the American Hockey League on Saturday and will back up Henrik Lundqvist when the Rangers play at Winnipeg on Sunday. In his last nine games with Hartford, the 22-year-old Georgiev went 8-0-1 with a 1.76 goals-against average, .948 save percentage and two shutouts. In 31 appearances, he has a 2.97 GAA and .908 save percentage. --Field Level Media
