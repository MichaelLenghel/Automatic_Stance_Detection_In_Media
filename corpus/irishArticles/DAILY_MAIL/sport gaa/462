While England is rocking with anticipation ahead of a first World Cup final in 12 years next weekend, it's a different story down in New Zealand. The All Blacks suffered a shock loss at the hands of Eddie Jones' men on Saturday - ending their hopes of landing the World Cup for the third tournament in a row. Defeat for Steve Hansen's men proved too much to take for sections of the New Zealand press, who reacted with distraught at the result. The Herald on Sunday marked the defeat with a front page that was left all black with just a small box of text in the centre. Trying to ignore the loss as much as possible, it simply pointed a message to the back page reading: 'The All Blacks are out of the World Cup. If you want to read more, go to the sports section.' The All Blacks' World Cup is still not over and they will now look to gain a form of consolation in Friday's third place play-off. In what will be Hansen's last game in charge they will face off against either Wales or South Africa who will contest the second semi-final on Sunday.
