Killed: The Garda officer in his 40s was among colleagues who were escorting a cash delivery to a credit union in Dundalk, Co Louth It is believed the force is now hunting four men in a grey Volkswagen Passat which fled the scene. The officer, who was based at Dundalk Garda station, was fatally injured in the shooting. It is understood the detective was a family man - married with three children. He lived in the Lordship area, around a kilometre (0.6 miles) from the credit union where he was killed. He was also a member of local GAA club St Patrick's. While he no longer plays, it is understood he was involved with training young players. Local councillor Jim Loughran knew the detective and described him as a quiet, decent family man. Incident: Several shots were fired during the incident at the Lordship Credit Union, on the Cooley Road in the town at around 9.30pm 'I just spoke to him last week on the street in town. I can't believe this has happened,' Mr Loughran said. The Sinn Fein councillor condemned those responsible for the shooting, saying they had devastated a small tight-knit community. 'This was not just an attack on a Garda detective, it was an attack on the whole community,' he said.
