By Associated Press   Published:  18:02, 2 May 2016   |  Updated:  18:02, 2 May 2016    NEW YORK (AP) — The New York Rangers have agreed to a deal with backup goalie Antti Raanta. The 26-year-old Raanta appeared in 25 games with the Rangers this season after being acquired from the Chicago Blackhawks in June. He had an 11-6-2 record, with a 2.24 goals-against average, a .919 save percentage and a shutout playing behind Henrik Lundqvist. Raanta, who is from Rauma, Finland, tied his career high in appearances and was eighth in the league in GAA. He allowed two goals or fewer in 13 of his 18 starts during the season. Raanta earned a win in each of his first four starts of the season, becoming the first goaltender in franchise history to register a win in each of his first four starts with the Rangers. He also was the fourth goaltender in franchise history to earn a shutout in his first start with the Rangers and the first to do so since Marcel Paille on Nov. 2, 1957. Raanta, who made three appearances in the Rangers' first-round playoff loss to the Penguins, said Monday on Twitter that he is looking forward to his second season with the team. He tweeted: "Great feeling to come back to @NYRangers thanks to the fans for a great first year and everybody who made NY feel like home!"
