The Rangers are hoping Strome can reach his potential with them. Strome was the fifth overall pick of the 2011 draft by the Islanders. "When you're a top-five pick overall there's a lot of pressure on you to perform," New York general manager Jeff Gorton said in a statement. "I think he feels like, and we feel like, maybe there's a little bit more that he can still get to the level we're all hoping he can get to." --Tampa Bay Lightning goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy will miss four to six weeks with a fractured left foot, the team announced.

Elliott was injured during the third period of Thursday's loss to the New Jersey Devils. He crouched in discomfort before leaving the ice.
