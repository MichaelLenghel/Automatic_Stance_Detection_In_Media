Toronto Maple Leafs goaltender Frederik Andersen has been cleared to return after missing four games with a neck injury. Andersen is slated to be in goal Thursday when the Maple Leafs host the Dallas Stars. "It feels like it's been awhile," Andersen told reporters after the morning skate. "I'm happy to be healthy and ready to play again." Andersen was injured on Feb. 3 after a collision with Florida Panthers forward Frank Vatrano with 1:36 remaining in the first period of a 5-3 loss. Andersen was able to finish the period before being replaced by Michael Hutchinson. Hutchinson was waived by the Maple Leafs on Thursday. Andersen is 24-9-6 with a 2.87 goals-against average and a .910 save percentage in 42 games this season. He was named an All-Star for the first time in his career. Overall, Andersen is 208-88-44 with a 2.62 GAA and .917 save percentage in seven NHL seasons with the Anaheim Ducks (2013-16) and Maple Leafs. --Field Level Media
