Goaltender Carter Hart could be with the Philadelphia Flyers to stay. The 2016 second-round pick was recalled Monday when goaltender Anthony Stolarz was placed on injured reserve. The team expects Stolarz to miss 2-4 weeks with a lower-body injury. Hart, 20, spent four seasons in the Western Hockey League and won Goaltender of the Year honors each of the past three seasons. This season, his first as a pro, he has a 9-5-2 record to go along with a 3.05 goals-against average and .901 save percentage with Lehigh Valley of the AHL. Hart has one shutout but won four of his past five starts. Stolarz left Saturday's game after nine consecutive appearances. He is 2-3-2 with a 3.90 GAA and .880 save percentage. Hart was Team Canada's goaltender for the World Junior Championships the past two years, winning silver (2017) and gold (2018) medals in net. --Field Level Media
