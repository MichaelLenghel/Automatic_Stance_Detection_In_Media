Ron Hextall finally found the Philadelphia Flyers a veteran goaltender. Hextall, GM of the Flyers and a former NHL goalie, resisted making a move for a netminder but with his top two options injured, the Flyers agreed on Tuesday to part with a conditional third-round pick in 2018 and another in 2019 to pry Petr Mrazek from the Detroit Red Wings. Starter Brian Elliott could miss the next five weeks with an abdominal injury and his primary backup for the Flyers, Michal Neuvirth, was injured on Sunday. Neuvirth was 3-0-1 since replacing Elliott on Feb. 10. Philadelphia is third in the Metropolitan Division entering Tuesday. This season, Mrazek, 26, is 8-7-2 with a 2.89 goals-against average and a .910 save percentage. He is 5-2-2 in his past 10 appearances with a 2.01 GAA. --Field Level Media
