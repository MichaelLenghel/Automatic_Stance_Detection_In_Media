The Calgary Flames signed restricted free agent goaltender Jon Gillies to a two-year, $1.5 million contract on Tuesday. Gillies went 3-5-1 with a 2.88 goals-against average and .896 save percentage last season, his second with the Flames. He made his NHL debut during the 2016-17 season, allowing just one goal on 28 shots in his lone start. "Looking back at my career path and the opportunities I've been given, I think I've shown my abilities to rise to the occasion," Gillies said, according to team's website. "If you look at my starts when [Mike Smith] was hurt and at the end of the year, I think I'm ready to take that next step." "I've been on a path where I've played a lot of games," he added. "I've had a lot of chances to show what I can do. This will be another one." Gillies was 17-16-3 with a 2.52 GAA, .917 save percentage and four shutouts in 39 games for Stockton of the American Hockey League last season. A third-round pick in the 2012 NHL Draft, the Flames expect the 24-year-old to build upon his experience with the team last season. "Last year was his first prolonged exposure at the NHL level and there were some really good things," Calgary general manager Brad Treliving told the team's website. "Jon has shown over his amateur career and career that he's a top-level prospect. You look at his frame (6-foot-6, 223 pounds), his athletic ability, his talent level, he's a guy who's knocking at the door. Now he's got to push that door down." --Field Level Media
