Vegas Golden Knights goaltender Malcolm Subban has a lower-body injury and is considered day-to-day, coach Gerard Gallant told reporters Friday. The Golden Knights plan to call up a goaltender on Saturday from their AHL affiliate, the Chicago Wolves, Gallant said. Vegas hosts the Calgary Flames on Saturday night and visits the Los Angeles Kings on Sunday night. Subban, 25, has allowed two goals in 20 minutes of action this season. He is 0-1-0 with a 6.00 goals-against average. In 46 career games (42 starts), Subban is 21-17-4 with a 2.91 GAA. Marc-Andre Fleury is the Golden Knights' primary goaltender, but it is uncertain whether he will start back-to-back nights over the weekend. --Field Level Media
