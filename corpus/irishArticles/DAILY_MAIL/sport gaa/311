By Sportsmail Reporter   Published:  23:13, 19 August 2012   |  Updated:  23:13, 19 August 2012     View  comments Ireland's plans to launch a formal bid to host the 2023 Rugby World Cup have been given a significant boost as the Gaelic Athletic Association have taken a first step towards making large Gaelic games stadia available for matches. Any bid by the IRFU would be dependent on outside assistance, due to the dearth of suitable rugby grounds – with only Lansdowne Road in Dublin (50,000) and Thomond Park in Limerick (26,000) offering the necessary size and facilities.  Possibilities: Ireland could use Croke Park to host the World Cup Therefore, the news that the GAA (Gaelic Athletic Association) will consider changing their regulations to permit co-operation with the bid for rugby’s showpiece event gives impetus to the prospective Irish bid. On Saturday, the GAA’s Central Council agreed to raise the matter at the organisation’s annual Congress. A positive ruling would clear the way for the IRFU to include in their bid Croke Park in Dublin – where Ireland played while Lansdowne Road was being redeveloped - Casement Park in Belfast, Cork’s Pairc Ui Chaoimh, the Limerick Gaelic Grounds, Fitzgerald Stadium in Killarney and Galway’s Pearse Stadium. Emphasising the determination of the IRFU to push forward with their bid plans, chief executive Philip Browne said: ‘The Rugby World Cup in New Zealand showed what a country of four million people could achieve in terms of attracting visitors and showcasing the potential of a country, so an overall Ireland bid is something that the government was keen to discuss with us. ‘We are at the early stages of examining the feasibility of a bid and part of this study is to determine the interest and support of Government and other relevant bodies.’
