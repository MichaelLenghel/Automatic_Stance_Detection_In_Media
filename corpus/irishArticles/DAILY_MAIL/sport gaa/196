The Montreal Canadiens have re-signed goaltender Antti Niemi to a one-year, $950,000 contract, the team announced Tuesday. Niemi was scheduled to become a free agent July 1. The 34-year-old had a 7-5-4 record with a 2.46 goals-against-average and a .929 save percentage in 19 games for the Canadiens last season. However, the one-way contract does not guarantee Niemi a roster spot for next season. He will battle with Charlie Lindgren for the backup job to Carey Price. Lindgren is also on a one-way contract. Niemi signed a one-year deal with the Pittsburgh Penguins last year after having his contract bought out by the Dallas Stars. However, he was waived by the Penguins after posting an 0-3 record with a 7.50 GAA and a .797 save percentage as Matt Murray's backup. The Florida Panthers put in a waiver claim on Niemi, but he played in just two games before being waived again, paving his way to hook on with Montreal. Niemi has played in 447 career NHL games, posting a 234-134-55 record with a 2.52 GAA and .913 save percentage over 10 seasons. --Field Level Media
