Halloween has officially come and gone, which means Bella and Gigi Hadid will likely need a day to recharge. The supermodel sisters were in attendance Thursday night at Kendall Jenner's Halloween birthday bash. They stepped out Friday in Beverly Hills, sporting some cozy chic looks after a night of partying. Bella, 23, kept it sexy and casual in a hot pink spaghetti strap with jeans and a pair of black Converses. Gigi, 24, donned an oversized grey flannel with matching sweatpants and a pair of chunky white sneakers. They hopped into their black Range Rover as they left their friends Hailey and Justin Bieber's house. Gigi took it back to 1994 for her Halloween costume, which she wore to Jenner's party at Blind Dragon. She stepped out in a yellow suit and green makeup, channeling Jim Carrey in The Mask. Bella also went with an iconic '90s look for her costume at the star-studded festivities. She went as Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman (aka Selina Kyle) from the 1992 flick Batman Returns.  It was one of two looks the brunette beauty rocked for the day of spooky festivities.  She also showed some skin in a sexy version of Fred Flinstone's prehistoric ensemble.
