The Chicago Blackhawks placed goaltender Corey Crawford on injured reserve Monday, a day after he was concussed when his helmet struck the goal post during a multi-player collision. The move is retroactive to Sunday. Chicago recalled goaltender Collin Delia from AHL affiliate Rockford for depth. Crawford, who turns 34 on New Year's Eve, missed most of last season and the first five games of this season while battling symptoms from a concussion sustained on Dec. 23, 2017. "Of course, we're concerned," head coach Jeremy Colliton told reporters after Sunday's 7-3 loss to the San Jose Sharks. Crawford was hurt after making a save on Logan Couture's mini breakaway late in the first period. Evander Kane drove the net and knocked Blackhawks defenseman Dylan Strome into Crawford, who was down in his butterfly. Crawford was bowled over, and the back of his helmet hit the post, with the net giving way as Strome fell on top of him. Kane was given a minor penalty for goaltender interference. After remaining down on the ice for a minute or two, Crawford skated off under his own power and walked with trainers to the locker room. He was replaced by Cam Ward and quickly ruled out by the team, with Colliton announcing the concussion diagnosis afterward. Crawford, who started for two Stanley Cup champions in Chicago, is 6-14-2 this season with a 3.28 goals-against average and .902 save percentage in 23 games. The 12th-year goalie topped 30 wins in six of seven seasons from 2010-11 to 2016-17 and has never finished a season with a record below .500. The Blackhawks signed Ward, 34, in free agency as insurance for Crawford. The longtime starter for Carolina is on a one-year deal worth $3 million, going 4-5-4 this season with a 4.17 GAA and .883 save percentage in 14 appearances. Delia, 24, made his NHL debut last March, stopping 56 of 63 shots in two games while going 1-1. He has a 7-5-4 record with a 2.34 GAA and .933 save percentage in 17 games for the IceHogs this season. --Field Level Media
