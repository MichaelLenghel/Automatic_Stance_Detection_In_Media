Pittsburgh Penguins goaltender Matt Murray will get the start against the Toronto Maple Leafs on Thursday after missing three games with a concussion. Murray's concussion occurred during a practice last week. It is his second known concussion in nine months and third of his career. His return comes against the league's top offense in the Maple Leafs, who are averaging 4.71 goals per game. "Every game is hard. We have so much respect for this league and how good the teams are. When's the ideal time to bring a guy back into the lineup? I'm not sure there is one," Penguins coach Mike Sullivan told reporters. "Matt's our No. 1 goalie. He's healthy. He's had a number of good practices. He's prepared for it. We just gotta go out and play well in front of him." Murray has allowed 11 goals in two games this season. The 24-year-old has a 69-29-8 record and 2.64 goals-against average in 113 career regular-season appearances (107 starts). His backup, Casey DeSmith, went 1-0-2 with a 2.59 GAA and .922 save percentage in his three starts. The Penguins are 2-1-2 to begin the season. --Field Level Media
