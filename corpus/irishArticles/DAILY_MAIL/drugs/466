A cocaine dealer who bragged about his lavish lifestyle faces 11 years behind bars after he was busted in a major police operation. Fitness trainer Matthew Maxamillion Hilton, 32, showed off his excessive life in the tropical party town of Cairns to his 12,000 Instagram followers. Pictures showed him driving expensive cars and speedboats, wearing designer clothes and jetting off on opulent holidays to destinations including Las Vegas. The former hairdresser, who owns a nightclub security company, also showed off his ripped physique in selfies taken in the gym.  But Hilton funded his life of luxury by selling drugs and was caught red-handed in 2018.  He was busted when police tapped his phone and planted recording devices in his car in a two-year operation to catch a major gang working between Sydney and Cairns. The operation, code-named Oscar Aymara, saw 39 people charged with 127 offences.  Hilton pleaded guilty to trafficking steroids, cocaine, crystal meth and ecstasy pills between March 1, 2016 and January 3, 2018. He faces eleven years in jail when sentenced at Queensland's Supreme Court on Wednesday. According to the Courier-Mail, the court previously heard that Hilton would boast his cocaine had a 'diesel smell of signature quality' and was 63 per cent pure. But he cut it with substances like creatine to double the amount and police tests found the purity to be only 10 per cent. Hilton sold cocaine for $300 a gram or to others dealers for $6,500 an ounce, the court heard.
