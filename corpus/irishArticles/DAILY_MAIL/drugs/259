A couple has been arrested after allegedly having oral sex in a Sydney park as parents and their children arrived at a nearby school. NSW Police say the 39-year-old man and 31-year-old woman "performed a sexual act" in Weekley Park in Stanmore on Monday morning just before the start of the school day. "At the time a number of parents and children were in or near the park as school was starting," a spokeswoman said in a statement. Officers allegedly found methamphetamines and cannabis when searching the man who was charged with wilful and obscene behaviour, offensive conduct and possessing prohibited drugs. He was granted bail to appear at Newtown Local Court on Monday. The woman was charged with offensive behaviour and granted bail to appear at the same court in mid-March.
