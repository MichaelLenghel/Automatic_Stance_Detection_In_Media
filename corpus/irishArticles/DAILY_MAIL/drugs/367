A man wearing a t-shirt reading 'Public Enemy No. 1' has been arrested and charged over the alleged supply of MDMA and cocaine. He was one of two men arrested by police on Thursday, accused of supplying drugs to the harbour city of Newcastle, two hours north of Sydney.  A 24-year-old man was arrested after police raided his home in Macquarie Hills, part of NSW's Hunter region, at 7.30am on Thursday.   A simultaneous police raid of a house in Elermore Vale on the outskirts of Newcastle, which resulted in the arrest of a 28-year-old man.  During the searches, officers seized 28g of MDMA, steroids, $15,000 cash, mobile phones, documents and other items relevant to the investigation before taking both men to Waratah Police Station. The 24-year-old man allegedly supplied 37 grams of MDMA and 35.5 grams of cocaine on several occasions between November 2019 and January 2020. He was charged with 32 offences, including nine counts of supply prohibited drug, two counts of supply prohibited drugs on an ongoing basis, and knowingly deal with proceeds of crime. Cocaine has an average street value of $300 per gram in Australia, meaning that the alleged sale of 35.5 grams could have net $10,650.  Meanwhile, MDMA powder costs $200 per gram, meaning that the alleged sale of 37 grams could have made $7,400.  The 28-year-old man allegedly supplied of 27.5 grams of cocaine between November 2019 and January 2020. He was charged with supply prohibited drug (between indictable and commercial quantity x2), supply prohibited drug (between small and indictable quantity x3), and supply prohibited drugs on an ongoing basis. NSW Drug and Firearms Squad Detectives began investigating the supply of prohibited drugs, including MDMA and cocaine, in the Newcastle and Hunter region in October 2019.  Investigations led detectives to receive two search warrants, which resulted in the two men being arrested during police raids on Thursday.  One of the men arrested was wearing a 'Public Enemy No. 1' T-shirt, a term that was widely used by the FBI in the 1930s to refer to notorious gangsters or fugitives.  Public Enemy is also a US hip hop group consisting of Chuck D, Flavor Flav, Professor Griff, and DJ Lord, who also released a song called Public Enemy Number One.  Police were pictured wearing protective gear and one wielded a battering ram during Thursday's raid.  Both accused men were refused bail to appear at Newcastle Local Court on Friday.   Investigations under Strike Force Pallamana are continuing.
