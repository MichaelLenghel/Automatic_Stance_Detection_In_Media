All 83 people being held in quarantine at Arrowe Park Hospital in the Wirral are free of the virus and will be able to leave their accommodation on Thursday morning.  The detainees - who were being kept in a block of apartments - have all been tested and found not to have the virus. Five coaches - carrying the 83 Britons who were on board the Wamos Air Boeing 747 on January 31 - were escorted into the Merseyside hospital by five police officers on motorbikes.  Three ambulances were also in the convoy as well as two police cars. They were taken by drivers without protective masks, raising fears for their safety. Coach drivers who took those evacuated from Wuhan to their quarantine location on the Wirral will also spend 14 days in isolation themselves.  They were asked to drive those brought back from China without any masks or specialist clothing – and will now take a period of paid leave away from others. It comes as two British prisoners including a 'drug dealer' who were sent home from Thailand were found not to have coronavirus.  Mark Rumble, 31, from Oxfordshire, was sent to HMP Bullingdon, close to Bicester, on January 27 and faces a series of charges of conspiracy to supply class A and B drugs. He is due in court later this month and is expected to deny the charges.  Thailand's ministry claimed Mr Rumble had no symptoms of the never-before-seen virus when he was tested before flying back to the UK.  And it said he passed all of the standard health checks prisoners go through before they are extradited, claiming he wouldn't have been allowed to travel had he failed.  Officials in Thailand, the first country outside of China to record a case on January 13, claim there have been no cases among the 300,000 prisoners in the country.
