Drug dealer Shaun Barker was put in a fishing esky, deprived of food and assaulted for weeks before his death. His captors tied him to a tree in a forest in Gympie, north of Brisbane. They put honey on his testicles for ants to eat off. Their motivation was to scare him into giving information, probably about stolen drugs. Some time in the weeks after he was kidnapped on December 10, 2013, Mr Barker died. He was reported missing the following month, but it was only in April 2014 that his charred remains were found scattered in the remote forest. Part of his skull and jawbone were first discovered, followed by bone fragments and eventually more parts of his skeleton. Some burnt bones were found in a fire pit. His cause of death could not be determined, but Brisbane Supreme Court Justice David Jackson says Mr Barker died as a result of the circumstances in which he was kept, the assaults and deprivations he suffered. Commercial fishermen Stephen John Armitage, 50, and his son Matthew Leslie Armitage, 27, together with William Francis Dean, 43, were on Wednesday sentenced to jail for Mr Barker's manslaughter. Stephen Armitage and Dean were sentenced to 10 years' jail each, while Matthew Armitage was sentenced to eight years in prison. The trio's murder convictions were overturned last year when an appeal court found they did not intend for Mr Barker to die. The men have also been convicted of interfering with Mr Barker's corpse. The appeal court ordered a retrial on a torture charge, but the prosecution has dropped the charge.
