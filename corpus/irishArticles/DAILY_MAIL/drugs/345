A man has been charged after police locked down parts of a regional Queensland city following reports he was armed. An exclusion zone was established on Friday in Toowoomba, west of Brisbane, taking in Hunter St, Jackson St, South St and Jewell St. Officers went to an address on Hunter Street at 6.55am following reports of a stolen vehicle and possibly an armed man. Specialist police were sent to the scene and members of the public inside the exclusion zone were urged to stay indoors. At 10.40am, police said the 31-year-old man had been taken into custody without incident. No gun was located, however police allegedly found ammunition in the ceiling. Methylamphetamine, drug utensils and a set of keys which belonged to a stolen vehicle were also discovered. The man has been charged with obstructing a police officer, stealing, wilful damage, and possessing dangerous drugs along with other offences. He is due to face the Toowoomba Magistrates Court on Saturday.
