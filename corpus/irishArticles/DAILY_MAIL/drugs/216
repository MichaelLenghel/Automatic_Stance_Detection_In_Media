US prosecutors have called for a Los Angeles cocaine smuggler to be sentenced to 11 years' prison because of the "danger" he posed to Australians. Vardges Markosyan will be sentenced in a downtown LA courtroom on Friday. The 47-year-old from North Hollywood was a key player in a sophisticated cocaine smuggling operation that attempted to elude US and Australian border inspections by concealing and then suspending 37 kilograms of the drug in grease. The suspended cocaine was hidden in household items including a lamp stand, air compressor, log splitter and tankless water heaters and shipped to Australia where traffickers could pocket sky high prices. Prosecutors said 1kg of cocaine sold in Australia could fetch between $US136,000 ($A203,393) to $US226,000, well above the $US4,000 to $US50,000 traffickers could pocket in the US. "Defendant was part of a million-dollar drug network and actively assisted the attempted clandestine export of drugs across borders," prosecutors Brandon Fox and Puneet Kakkar wrote in their sentencing memorandum. "This conduct should be sanctioned, not only because of the abuse of the international shipping system that occurred, but also because of the danger to society posed - particularly in Australia - by attempting to send such high and valuable quantities of drugs." Markosyan entered guilty pleas in November to conspiracy to distribute cocaine and conspiracy to engage in money laundering charges.
