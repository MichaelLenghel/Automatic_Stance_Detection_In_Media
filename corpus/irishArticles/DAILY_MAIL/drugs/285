Costa Rican officials say they have seized more than five tons of cocaine - the largest haul in the Central American country's history.  Police intercepted the cocaine bound for the Dutch port of Rotterdam on Saturday to make the country's largest ever drugs bust, officials said. The authorities found the cocaine in Costa Rica's Caribbean port of Limon, stashed inside a shipping container of decorative canopy plants bound for the Netherlands. The anti-narcotics police discovered the drugs in 202 small bags and said the cocaine was produced in South America, though did not specify where. The drugs had an estimated street value of about $136 million (€126 million) in Holland, Costa Rica's Security Minister Michael Soto said late on Saturday. 'It's a historic seizure,' Soto said in a statement. 'It is a blow to the regional criminal structures.' A a 46-year-old Costa Rican man, who drove the shipment from north of the country to Limon port, was the only person detained as of Sunday, authorities said. The Public Security Ministry said the haul came to around 5,048 kilograms (11,128 pounds) of cocaine. Costa Rican officials last year reporting seizing 45.7 tons of cocaine, but the largest individual seizures never topped two tons.
