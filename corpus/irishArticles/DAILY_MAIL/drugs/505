A reckless driver has remarkably survived after hurtling off a cliff at 125mph and crashing into the sea. Pedestrians dived out of the way of the supposedly drugged-up motorist, 26, as he lost control of the Skoda Fabia and whizzed towards the precipice in Son Veri, Nou, Majorca, on Sunday morning.  Despite appearing to smash into rocks and rip chunks off the vehicle while racing across the bumpy clifftops, he flew off the edge with such velocity that pictures show the sunken vehicle shot quite a distance.  A group of passing cyclists jumped into the water to drag the driver out of the submerged car, and emergency crews were scrambled to the crash site. The driver, who is from the Spanish island, was injured and rushed to the hospital in Son Espases, where there have been no updates on his condition.  He was arrested and taken into custody, before being charged with a crime against traffic security, reckless driving and driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs - the latter offence he is reported to have admitted, without specifying the drugs. The unnamed driver claimed he had been travelling alone, but firefighter divers were sent to the wreckage to check for any further victims. A video of the operation shows them kitted up in full scuba gear, rolling backwards off the sponsons of a RIB floating near the sunken car. The water is flat calm and the water is shallow, making the Skoda - resting on the sea bed - easily visible to the camera, which is believed to be attached to a drone. The pair of divers kick over to the silver vehicle and haul open the car doors and squeeze inside. After quickly sweeping the car, they exit and regroup outside. Photographs show firefighers standing on the cliff overlooking the divers, watching them intently.
