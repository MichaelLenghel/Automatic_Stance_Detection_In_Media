Colorado State kicker Cayden Camper was arrested for suspicion of drunken driving or driving while impaired by alcohol or drugs. According to The Coloradoan, Fort Collins police stopped the 19-year-old early Sunday morning and booked him into the Larimer County Jail. No other details were released. The charge is a misdemeanor. As a freshman walk-on for the Rams in 2019, Camper made 7 of 13 field goals and all 18 extra-point attempts. He booted a 50-yard field goal against UNLV on Nov. 2. A Colorado State football spokesperson said the program "is aware of the situation and are currently gathering more information." --Field Level Media
