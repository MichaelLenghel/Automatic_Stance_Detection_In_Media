A BMW-driving school teacher who had just returned to Australia from Peru has been hit and killed by a truck on a NSW highway after allegedly being tied up by two people in a nearby home. Brisbane-based teacher Anthony Stott, 43, was killed on the M1 near Cudgera Creek in the Tweed shire on Monday, NSW Police said on Wednesday. NSW Police say Mr Stott's BMW was located in the middle of the M1 at 2am on Monday - a short distance from the Kanes Road home where he was allegedly tied up. He was struck by the truck while walking along the highway about 7am. Detectives allege Mr Stott was tied to a chair by the two people at their home between 2am and 7am. It's not known how he got to and from the property. It's also unclear if he was released or broke free from the chair. "We believe he was detained against his will at that premises prior to his death ... these circumstances are very troubling," Acting Superintendent Brendon Cullen told reporters on Wednesday. Acting Supt Cullen said Mr Stott had last been seen at Brisbane Airport on Sunday afternoon having returned home from a trip to Peru. A 38-year-old woman and a 46-year-old man have been charged with taking or detaining a person with intent to obtain advantage. They were refused bail to appear at Tweed Heads Local Court on February 17. Mr Stott's relationship with the pair remains unclear. "How he ended up at the property is unclear to us - that's what we're seeking assistance with," Acting Supt Cullen said. "We don't know what that relationship is, how he ended up in the house or why." Act Supt Cullen didn't rule out the involvement of drugs.
