More than 10 children, one aged 13, were stripped searched for drugs at a Sydney underage music festival, a year after police were criticised for doing the same thing to a 15-year-old boy.  Eleven children were searched by NSW police at the Lost City festival in Sydney on Saturday. Officers say 44 revellers were searched by police, with 11 being strip searched, at the event for teenagers aged from 13 to 17.  In 2019 a 15-year-old boy was forced to expose his genitals during a police search causing a backlash from some community members. Redfern Legal Centre's Samantha Lee said if a parent or guardian wasn't present then a child shouldn't be searched, unless under extreme circumstances.  'If they're not going to have a parent or guardian present, then they must have a very good reason as to why that person isn't going to be available,' Miss Lee told ABC News.  'So it is unclear what information was provided to the child that ensured they fully understood the testing they were being subjected to.' Police also charged two teenagers, a 14-year-old girl and a 17-year-old boy, with alleged drug supply at the festival.  Meanwhile a 15-year-old boy was charged with possess prohibited drug and breach of bail.  Another 14 teenagers were allegedly found with prohibited drugs and police said they will be dealt with under the Young Offenders Act.  Officers also ejected 27 people from the premises for intoxication, drug-related matters and anti-social behaviour.  Despite conducting searches NSW police did not test for drugs or alcohol, instead a third party contractor was hired by festival organisers.   Daily Mail Australia has contacted Lost City organisers for comment.
