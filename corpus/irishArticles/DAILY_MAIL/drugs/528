Hundreds of cannabis plants and a shocking haul of weapons were seized by police in a single day in Kent.  Officers came across a suspicious locked building on a farm in Sevenoaks, Kent that housed 650 plants, having found a number of power cables and a water supply. Earlier that day at 10am, a search warrant had been executed at a home in Colstead. Kent Police said they discovered two upstairs rooms in the property that had been turned into cannabis farms. Officers took 76 plants from the scene and around 2kg of the Class B drug, which were bagged and ready to sell. Police also seized an axe, a knuckle duster, and knives, which were also found at the home. There have been no arrests made in relation to either search. Sevenoaks chief inspector, Jon Kirby, said: 'We will continue to actively target people and criminal gangs engaged in the manufacture and supply of drugs, regardless of the scale of the operation. 'These plants, as well the equipment seized here, will all be destroyed. 'There can also be no justification for anyone carrying weapons, such as those seized by my officers. 'We are all too aware of the devastating consequences of knife crime, often at the needless cost of young lives and we remain firmly committed to protecting our communities from the harm it causes. 'Removing these weapons from our streets is an absolute priority and this includes taking a zero tolerance approach, where officers are proactively pursuing and prosecuting those offenders who think it acceptable to carry them.'
