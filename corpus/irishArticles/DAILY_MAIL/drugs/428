A young hairdresser has admitted to hiding cocaine and ketamine in a condom in her underwear to take into a music festival.  Tayah Crowther, 19, was stopped by a drug dog while at Field Day festival in Sydney on January 1. She immediately admitted to possessing cocaine and was taken to a private tent where she pulled out a condom which contained three small clear resealable bags. Despite knowing it was illegal, she had decided to 'take a punt', the Gosford Local Court was told on Tuesday. During her appearance, the court heard how Crowther, who is a senior hair stylist at a salon in Sydney, had hidden two bags of cocaine and one of ketamine, the Daily Telegraph reported. She told police during questioning she 'may have grabbed the wrong condom when her and her friend both placed their drugs into condoms before the festival', the court was told. 'The accused was polite and cooperative with police at all times through the whole interaction,' police said. Solicitor Denise McCarthy told the court the getting caught was 'an epiphany' for her client and her attitude about drugs. She said Crowther was remorseful.  Crowther pleaded guilty to two counts of possessing a prohibited drug. Magistrate Alan Railton slammed Crowther's actions after the highly publicised issues around drugs at festivals last year. Crowther was given a community service order and a good behaviour for 12 months. No conviction was recorded.
