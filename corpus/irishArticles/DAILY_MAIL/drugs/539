Ellis Genge ripped into England's critics, branding them 'sausages', after coming off the bench to score the only try at Murrayfield. Genge barrelled over from close range to score and get England's Six Nations' campaign up and running following last Sunday's shock loss against France. He said on Saturday's attritional Calcutta Cup success should shut up the critics who rounded on Eddie Jones and his team after their disaster in Paris. 'We had a bump in the road last week, that's all,' said the Leicester prop. 'Everyone was writing us off saying that we weren't good enough and saying that our coach should be sacked and the boys were a different team from the World Cup. It's classic: a lot of sausages saying things that just come into their head and what are they on about? We go out and win in Scotland away in the rain and now everyone's singing our praises. 'We're on to the next job now and I'm sure we'll have more critics. It happens every week. You lose a game and suddenly you can't play rugby any more. I hope we've shut all the critics up and I hope they watched that game as well.' Genge had been on the pitch only 12 minutes when he powered in under the posts, although his memory of the try is vague. 'I can't remember,' he said. 'It was all a bit of a blur and happened quite quick. Obviously you don't really plan for anything like that to happen and I was the lucky one to pick it up.' He added that celebrations were muted because some players had to go routine drugs tests. 'That takes the sting out of it when some of the boys aren't there,' he admitted. 'But we're buzzing.'
