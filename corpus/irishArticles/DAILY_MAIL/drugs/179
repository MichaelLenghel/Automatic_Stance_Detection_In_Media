Special Agent Ken Culverson said investigatorssearched the house andfound 8.8 grams of methamphetamine, 489 doses of LSD, several painkillers and multiple marijuana-based drugs including 5,621 grams of THC oil in mason jars, 729 grams of THC wax, 67 marijuana edibles and 1,110 grams of marijuana. Culverson said the estimated street value of the drugs was $1,031,235. Six people were arrested in connection with the home invasion and fatal shooting. Ceuion English, 23; Anthony Foster, 23; Laqwane Kindred, 26; and Trevonuis Williams, 22, were charged with murder on Jan. 22 and brought to Muscogee County Jail. Two female juveniles also were arrested. A judge ordered Tillery to be held without bond on Tuesday. Tillery told the judge she was "going to die in jail" because she feared for her life. She said she has been followed and threatened since her son was killed. Authorities said they are holding Tillery in a cell by herself and will transfer her to another jail if necessary.
