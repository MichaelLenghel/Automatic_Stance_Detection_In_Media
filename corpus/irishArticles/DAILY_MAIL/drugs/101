A Victorian man has been charged after he was found allegedly with a backpack containing ammunition, cash, drugs, a shotgun and taser. The man, 34, was first spotted by police riding a motorbike without number plates about 12:30pm on Saturday at Morwell but due to the speed he was travelling, officers decided it was unsafe to intercept him. He was arrested a short time later after attempting to run away from police on foot. When officers searched his backpack they allegedly found a shotgun broken into three pieces and wrapped in cloth, a taser, knife, cash, six rounds of ammunition and three shotgun cartridges filled with the drug ice. He was remanded in custody to appear at the Latrobe Valley Magistrates Court on Monday, charged with a number of assault, firearms and traffic offences as well as possessing drugs and proceeds of crime.
