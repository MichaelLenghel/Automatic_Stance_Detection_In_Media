A man drove his Jeep off the roof of a six-story parking garage just seconds after two people managed to jump out of the car to safety, authorities said.  The 20-year-old driver was found in the crumpled Jeep shortly after midnight in Santa Monica, about two blocks from the Santa Monica Pier.  Cops investigating the crash said it's not clear why the man drove off the roof, or whether he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol. They added that the driver, who was not immediately identified, was conscious and speaking with officers when they arrived, but was later taken to hospital in a critical condition. The two female passengers who managed to escape to safety were not injured.    The Jeep appeared to have broken through the wire fence on the sixth level of the parking garage before it plunged to the street.  The destroyed car had landed against a McDonald's building across the street from the garage after the plunge.  Firefighters extricated him from the wreckage and took him to a local trauma center, where he was listed in critical condition, the Santa Monica Fire Department said. Police in the coastal city were investigating the cause.  Because the man was receiving medical treatment, investigators said they were not yet able to determine whether drugs or alcohol were a factor.
