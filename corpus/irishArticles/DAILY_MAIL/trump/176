A vast majority of Americans believe Donald Trump will win reelection in November, according to a poll taken before the Nevada caucuses. Regardless of political preference and whether or not they are voting for him, 65 per cent of registered voters think Trump will definitely or probably emerge victorious, a CBS News/YouGov poll released Monday revealed. Republicans are extremely optimistic about the incumbent president’s chances, with more than nine in 10 indicating they expect him to win. Democrats are a bit more cautious, with more than one-third claiming they think Trump will serve another four years.  The survey was conducted February 20-22, which means some were questioned before the Nevada caucuses, while others were done as the results were rolling in. Bernie Sanders was declared the winner of the western state after only 3 per cent reporting when he took a massive lead right out the gate over the rest of the Democratic primary field. Now, with more than 95 per cent of precincts reporting in, Sanders is shown the victor with more than 46 per cent and the next closest candidate is former Vice President Joe Biden, who is more than 26 per cent behind with 20.4 per cent. Even though most voters believe Trump’s reelection will become reality in November, potential head-to-head matchups of the president and other candidates still show all major Deocratic candidates in a tight race. When told to select their preference between the top six top polling Democratic candidates and Trump, the results showed a 3 per cent or less margin between the two. Sanders, a Vermont senator who won the New Hampshire primaries and Nevada caucuses – and who has also declared victory in the Iowa caucuses – is shown with 47 per cent support to Trump’s 45. But former Vice President Joe Biden, who has performed surprisingly poorly in the early primary contest states so far, is shown with the same exact results when put up against the incumbent president. In Iowa, Biden came in fourth place, in New Hampshire fifth, and he finally came back up to the top when he came in second place in Nevada – but a distant second. Two of the top remaining female candidates, Senators Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren, are shown within a 1 per cent margin of the president – but Warren has preference over the president wile Klobuchar is shown losing. There is one more female candidate remaining in the field, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, but she has largely dropped off the map as she has failed to qualify for the last few Democratic primary debates and has not earned any delegates in the first three primary contest states. Former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg is tied with Trump in the new poll, both with 44 per cent. Billionaire Mike Bloomberg has the same margin as Sanders and Biden, but is the only candidate among the top polling contenders that is shown losing against the president. In the hypothetical matchup, Bloomberg earned 42 per cent and Trump earned 45 per cent. Several of the Democratic candidates have likened Bloomberg to Trump, and during the ninth primary debate in Las Vegas on Wednesday, the former New York City mayor was excoriated by his fellow candidates. Only 42 per cent of Democratic primary voters who participated in the poll say they have definitely made up their minds on who they are voting for. The poll has a margin of error of 1.2 percentage points, and when only considering Democratic primary voters, that margin increased to 1.7 points.
