NEW DELHI, Feb 25 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that no country is trying to help him win the election, days after a top intelligence official told lawmakers Russia was interfering in the 2020 presidential vote to help Trump win a second term. "I want no help from any country and I haven't been given help from any country," Trump told reporters at a news conference in India. U.S. officials have also said that Russia has been mounting disinformation and propaganda campaigns to help Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination in this year's election.
