Brumbies fullback Tom Banks admits his "bitterly disappointing" World Cup snubbing is motivation to force his way back into Wallaby gold this year. Banks has been in scintillating form for the 3-1 Brumbies who sit top of the Australian conference heading into their Super Rugby bye this week. The speedster has played every minute, scored three tries, made five line breaks and 314 run metres, while his precision kicks for touch have set up five maul tries. The calls are growing louder for Banks to add to his six Tests and wear the No. 15 jersey for Australia when they host Ireland and Fiji in July. Banks was one of the unluckiest players to miss Michael Cheika's World Cup squad last year but has a renewed focus thanks to a promise from new Wallabies coach Dave Rennie. Rennie vowed a clean slate at the selection table during his tenure and that form would trump reputation. "I was bitterly disappointed to miss that squad but the key was to try and get back and play some good footy," Banks said. "It's going to be picked on form and how you do during the year so I think that gives everyone confidence, you need to play well to get that gold jersey. "But it definitely helps to play on a winning team." Banks praised Brumbies coach Dan McKellar for allowing him the attacking freedom this season to force his way back into the international arena. "The biggest thing for me was to try and get involved more, the coaches have been really good with that, getting me to be more effective," Banks said. "They've allowed me to pop up when I want to and inject myself in the backline. They've really given me the confidence to attack the way I want. "Whether that's coming closer to the ball or coming into playmaker, there's a few ways and they've really allowed me to open up."
