The Mail on Sunday's journalists have been nominated for a fabulous SEVENTEEN trophies in the prestigious annual Press Awards, known as the Oscars of journalism. The formidable team pictured here are nominated for individual awards. In addition, the MoS is shortlisted for Sunday Newspaper of the Year, You for Magazine of the Year, and our City and finance staff for the Business and Finance Team award. Small wonder the MoS is recognised when the paper is enjoying a huge wave of success.  Our January circulation was 893,000 copies per week – more on average than we sold in September, October, November and December – with a year-on-year performance 4.4 per cent better than our audited rivals.  We are by far the most read Sunday paper in Britain – with 620 copies sold every minute on Sundays. Our agenda-setting exclusives have left other papers trailing. They include a devastating series of scoops about sex abuse accusations facing Prince Andrew – with another major development reported today.  Our revelations about what the British Ambassador in Washington really thought about Donald Trump made headlines around the world – and led to his resignation. You and Event are always the most-read Sunday magazines, and every week our readers are delighted, enraged, informed and entertained by fantastic writers including Peter Hitchens, Liz Jones, Piers Morgan, Craig Brown, Oliver Holt, Deborah Ross and Alexandra Shulman. The Society of Editors Press Awards winners will be announced on April 2. Our sister paper, the Daily Mail, is shortlisted in 22 categories, including Daily Newspaper of the Year.
