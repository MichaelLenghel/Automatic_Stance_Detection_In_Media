A New Jersey auction house is offering for sale a copy of the House of Representatives’ impeachment report signed by President Trump himself, and the bidding war could reach an astounding $40,000 for the historical item. Goldin Auctions in Runnemede says that Trump signed a copy of the documents in the middle of a campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan, on December 18 - the same night that the president was formally impeached. As of Friday afternoon, the leading bid for the autographed report stood at $26,000. The auction ends on Saturday night at 10pm Eastern Standard Time. Goldin Auctions says that it obtained the signed copy from Jonathan Moore, who was at Trump’s rally in Battle Creek. Moore told Goldin Auctions in a letter of provenance that the president ‘happily complied’ when he asked him to sign the documents. A letter of provenance is a document that certifies a product’s authenticity as well as its history of ownership. According to Goldin Auctions, Moore also obtained two letters from two separate companies - Beckett Authentication and PSA/DNA - confirming the authenticity of the signed document. Ken Goldin, the owner of Goldin Auctions, told DailyMail.com that he was told about ‘somebody within the Republican Party who has access to meet-and-greets.’ He said he received an email indicating that the signed report could be made available for his auction house if he wanted it. ‘This is the most historical item that he ever will sign,’ Goldin told DailyMail.com ‘He signed his own impeachment document on the day he was impeached. It's truly a unique piece of American history.’ Goldin said he believes the item could fetch up to $40,000. ‘I'm not a Democrat or a Republican, I'm a capitalist,’ he said.
