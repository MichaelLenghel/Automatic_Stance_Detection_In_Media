NEW DELHI, Feb 25 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday criticised two liberal-leaning justices on the nation´s top court, saying Supreme Court justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg should recuse themselves from any cases involving him. He cited comments Sotomayor made in a recent dissent that were critical of the Trump administration. Trump, at a news conference at the end of a two-day visit to India, called Sotomayor's comments "inappropriate".
