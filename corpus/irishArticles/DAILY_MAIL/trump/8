BERLIN, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Harvey Weinstein's conviction for sexual assault and rape should put an end to such behaviour, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on Tuesday and defended her past acceptance along with other Democrats of his political donations. Speaking at the Berlin Film Festival, where Nanette Burstein presented her documentary series "Hillary", Clinton declined to endorse any of the contenders for the party's presidential nomination to challenge Donald Trump, who defeated her in 2016 in his first run for public office. "I'm going to wait and see who we nominate," she said. "I will support the nominee. And it won't surprise you to hear me say that I think that it's imperative that we retire the incumbent." The U.S. election takes place on Nov. 3. While Weinstein, once one of Hollywood's most influential producers, had contributed to her political campaigns, she said he had contributed to many other Democratic candidates. "He contributed to every Democrat's campaign. He contributed to Barack Obama's campaign and John Kerry's campaign and Al Gore's campaign and everybody's campaign," she said. "I don't know whether that should chill anyone else from contributing to political campaigns, but it certainly should end the kind of behaviour that he was just convicted for." Weinstein, who had such hit films as "The English Patient" and "Shakespeare in Love", was found guilty of sexual assault and rape in New York on Monday. "The jury's verdict really speaks for itself," Clinton said, adding: "It was time for an accounting." Burstein said "Hillary", based on seven days of interviews with Clinton, aimed to give an intimate portrait of a polarising figure. (Reporting by Thomas Escritt; Editing by Howard Goller)
