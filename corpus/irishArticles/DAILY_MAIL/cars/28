A confused motorcyclist is questioning her $268 fine for parking in a no-stopping zone. The Sydney rider posted a picture of her white motorbike to a local Facebook group and asked for advice. The picture showed the motorbike parked beneath a no stopping sign and next to a thick white line on the road.   The rider explained: 'I went for holidays for two weeks and I left my scooter parked in front of my building (with a valid parking permit). 'Because I didn't want to leave the scooter for two weeks in the middle of the parking zone, so other cars can park easily, I left it right at the end of the parking zone, which is marked by a thick white line (?!),' she continued.  Once she returned from her trip the motorcyclist found out that she had been slapped with a $268 fine for disobeying a no stopping sign.    She asked the group: 'Can someone please advise if there is a reasonable grounds to dispute this in the court?' She ended her message with a P.S that said: 'If you think that fine was given correctly because I'm behind the pole can you please at least explain what the white, thick line on the floor is for?!'  According to NSW Roads and Maritime Services, motorcycles may angle park anywhere that it's legal to park. When it comes to no stopping signs the vehicle must not stop in the area marked out by the sign's arrow at any time.    The Roads and Maritime Services also noted that sometimes a no stopping area is indicated by a solid yellow edge line.  In the case of this motorcyclist, it is unclear what the thick white line represents but she did violate NSW road rules by parking within the direction of the no stopping sign.
