Ex-Formula One star Rubens Barrichello will race in the S5000 category at the inaugural Bathurst International. The 47-year-old Brazilian, who competed in the debut of the V8-powered open wheel category at Sandown last year, has signed on to race in the S5000 class at March's Australian Grand Prix and then at Mount Panorama in November. Touted as Australia's fastest racing cars, the S5000s have the potential to break the lap record at the iconic 6.2km Bathurst circuit. Barrichello started a record 322 Grands Prix during his F1 career and organisers are hopeful he'll be the first of many international drivers to accept invitations to race at the Bathurst International from November 13-15. Ex-Formula One world champions Jenson Button, Nico Rosberg and Fernando Alonso are also understood to be in the sights of organisers. Barrichello was confident he will not be the last big name eager to race the S5000s at Mount Panorama. "The Grand Prix event will allow many, many international drivers to see - and hear - S5000, and they will then understand the attraction," he said. "At Bathurst, after most international series have concluded, will bring the opportunity to drive a special car around a circuit all Australians love, which I would expect to attract drivers from all over the world. "It will be an exciting end to the year for sure." Barrichello will drive for Team BRM at both the Grand Prix and the Bathurst International event in the same red S5000 chassis that he drove at Sandown in September last year. The three-day Bathurst event will include a TCR Bathurst 500 touring car race, modern Trans Am muscle cars as well as the S5000s.
