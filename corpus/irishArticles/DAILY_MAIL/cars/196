This is the moment a group of men brought traffic to a standstill on a busy London road so they could pose for selfies in front of their supercars. The four men were spotted getting out of a Lamborghini Aventador and three Audis on the A406 North Circular Road in east London yesterday afternoon. Dressed in smart dinner suits, they were seen on foot amid busy traffic taking pictures of themselves with their smart phones.  Other drivers were forced to wait and were unable to get by until the 'photo shoot' ended. Some of the cars were being driven illegally, with the green Lamborghini on the road without tax, the yellow Audi declared off the road and the grey Audi without an MOT. The Lamborghini is a limited-run Aventador SVJ model, of which just 900 were produced. Prices start from £360,000 for the supercar, which has a 6.5-litre naturally-aspirated V12 engine producing a massive 759bhp.  From a standing start, the low-slung Lamborghini can hit 60mph in 2.9 seconds and go on to a top speed of 217mph.  MailOnline has contacted the Metropolitan Police and Transport for London for comment.  The shocking images were posted online by a driver held up by the supercar drivers.  The caption read: 'holding up the A406 today celebrating in the road... no idea why. Traffic caused was massive at 4pm.'  Someone responded jokingly to the post: 'Not exactly the most picturesque location..' Another quipped: 'Classy and understated'.  Another person commented: 'When you rent a Lamborghini you do HAVE to get your moneys worth.' And another user said: 'Billionaires or sons of diplomats. Nothing will be done about it .'  Do you recognise the men in the pictures? Email lara.keay@mailonline.co.uk
