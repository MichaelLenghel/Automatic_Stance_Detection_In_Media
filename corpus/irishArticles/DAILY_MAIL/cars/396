Rain forced the postponement of Sunday's 62nd running of the Daytona 500 after just 20 laps had been completed. The race was rescheduled for Monday, with a start time of 4 p.m. ET at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Fla. Dale Earnhardt Jr. was scheduled to wave the race-commencing green flag at just after 3 p.m. on Sunday. Because of pre-race activities involving President Donald J. Trump and then a rain shower on the final parade lap, the race began at about 4:20 p.m. But 20 laps in, a much heavier rain began to fall at the 2.5-mile, high-banked oval, and out came the yellow, and then red flags. At 6:40 p.m., NASCAR told drivers to report to their cars and uncover them and prepare to race. But before the race could take to the track, the rain began to pour again. At about 6:49 p.m., NASCAR officials announced the postponement. Ricky Stenhouse Jr. of JTG Daugherty Racing started the race from the pole and was still in the lead when the rain came. He led all 20 laps. Right behind him was Joey Logano of Team Penske. Aric Almirola, Ryan Newman and Kevin Harvick rounded out the top five. Denny Hamlin, the winner of last year's 500, was forced to start from the rear of the field after his Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota twice failed pre-race inspection. He had been scheduled to start 21st in the 40-car field. --Field Level Media
