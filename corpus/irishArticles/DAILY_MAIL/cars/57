This is the moment a speeding bus misses a woman by inches after she suddenly 'felt a bit light-headed' and fell on to a road. The heart-stopping footage was captured in the town of Azov, southern Russia.  In the CCTV, a woman dressed in a white winter jacket and blue jeans carrying a black plastic bag, can be seen approaching a bus stop. Her movements gradually become more unsteady as she ambles along the roadside.      The woman steps off the pavement edge and turns around to face oncoming traffic. Moments later, her legs give way and she falls backwards in front of a hurtling bus.  In a lucky turn of events, the bus wheels narrowly miss her head by inches and she miraculously escapes death.   She then struggles to balance herself and get back on to her feet as an approaching car slows down.   A woman, who is wearing black clothes, approaches and reportedly asks if she needs help. It is thought that the walker suddenly 'felt a bit light-headed and lost her balance', according to local media.  The clip was broadcast by numerous Russian TV channels, though none of them have reported what happened with the woman aftermath. It remains unclear whether the woman was hospitalised and her current health condition.
