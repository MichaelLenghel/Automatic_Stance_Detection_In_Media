A driver has been slammed for parking his ute across two spots dedicated for cars with disability permits. A frustrated motorist snapped a picture of the white HiLux and trailer stopped in a car park at Bayview Park in Sydney's Northern Beaches. The image was shared with Facebook group Downrigger Shop, who posted it to Facebook on Thursday. 'He must be the most important person in the world,' one viewer commented. 'That's some next level ignorance,' wrote another. A follow-up picture showed the motorist was fined $572 for 'park vehicle in designated disability parking space'.  One viewer argued the motorist should have received two fines for the offence as they parked over two disability spots. Motorists with a permit under the Mobility Parking Scheme are able to receive parking concessions in New South Wales.
