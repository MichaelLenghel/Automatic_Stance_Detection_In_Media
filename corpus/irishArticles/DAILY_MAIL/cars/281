This is the hilarious moment a kid's glasses fell out of a van window while he was dancing to music.  Valentino Di Francesca, 12, from Argentina, was dancing with sister Martina, 17, in the back of their family's van when he became completely he began energetically pulling some moves to the song.  As he shakes his head to the beat and really gets into the tune, his glasses slip off his face. The boy's glasses suddenly fly off and are tossed out the window, landing in the midst of traffic. Martina captured the hilarious reaction of her brother and he screamed with horror at the realisation of having lost his glasses. Valentino said: 'Initially I was very scared because I thought a car must have crushed them. 'Then I killed myself with laughter when I saw the video because of my reaction. 'My mum went to retrieve the glasses, warning other cars not to crush them. 'Now they are missing a few pieces but they can be fixed.'
