He may have been more then 6,000 miles away but that didn't stop a soldier stationed in Iraq from calling the cops in Chicago after spotting two robbers allegedly breaking into his home. Soldier Richard Wharton was viewing his doorbell camera via the Nest app on his smartphone when he noticed two people leave his garage with some of his power tools. He immediately called the Park Ridge police to alert them of the suspected theft and explained how he had video evidence of a crime being committed.   Park Ridge cops responded quickly and spotted two men weighed down with the stolen electric tools according to Fox32. Andres Gutierrez and Brandon Shaw were arrested at around 2.30am on Friday and taken into custody.  'He saw it and watched it and communicated great with us and called us right away,' Tom Gadomski with Park Ridge police said.  'We had officers right in the area and found the offenders and took them into custody.'  Police say they are suspected of stealing items from parked cars in the area as well.  Gutierrez and Shaw were charged with three counts of burglary.  'The Park Ridge Police Department extends our sincere appreciation to Soldier Richard Wharton who, while protecting his country overseas, also assisted his hometown police department in the apprehension of two burglary suspects,' the police wrote in a statement.
