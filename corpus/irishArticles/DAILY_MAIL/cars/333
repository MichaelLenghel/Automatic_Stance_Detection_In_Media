 New York City straphangers recently had to make way for a crew of motorbike riders in a scene that a passerby described as 'absurd.' Video posted to Twitter Sunday night shows three men rolling their motorbikes across a crowded subway platform and onto train cars, in an apparent violation of city laws. 'This is not only alarming for other passengers but it's completely unsafe,' said MTA Chief Safety Officer Patrick Warren, according to the Daily News. 'Motorized vehicles pose a hazard to our customers and are banned in the subway system.' The video doesn't immediately identify the subway station, but an overhead announcement suggests the trio were boarding a Queens-bound F train at the 47th-50th Rockefeller Center station.   Two of the men can be seen rolling their motorbikes into one train car while the third rider attempts a right turn — only to pause to avoid hitting someone — before rolling his bike into the next car. An off-camera bystander can be heard describing the situation as 'absurd,' while Twitter users denounced the scene as 'complete lawlessness' and 'rude, disrespectful.' The NYPD is investigating the matter, according to the New York Post.
