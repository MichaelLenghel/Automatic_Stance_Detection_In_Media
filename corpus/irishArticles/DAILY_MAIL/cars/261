Ride-sharing company Uber has introduced the 'quiet mode' in their cars so passengers can choose to avoid the awkward small talk. Australian 'Uber Comfort' riders will now have the option to request a 'quiet trip' - without any music or conversation with the driver - or a 'chatty one'. 'So if you're dialling into a conference call on the way to the office, you can request a quiet trip to maximise productivity,' the company said. You also have full temperature control, whether you prefer warm, hot, cool or cold, riders can opt for the setting to be turned on before you even hop into the car. With extended wait times, drivers can wait up to 10 minutes - a perfect option if you're held up in a meeting but need your ride ready to go the minute you are.  'We know you value your time, and so do we. With extended wait times your driver will now wait up to 10 minutes,' the brand said. Uber Australia and New Zealand general manager Dom Taylor said the new features are on top of the existing Uber Comfort benefits including newer cars and experienced drivers. For around 1.2 times the cost of an UberX, passengers travelling with Uber Comfort can expect a five-star ride. Passengers can arrive in comfort with a car that meets consistent vehicle make and model standards from 2013 onwards. Drivers available for Uber Comfort will have a minimum rating of 4.85 and at least 500 trips logged via the app.
