McLaren have unveiled the car they hope will take them another step forward on their journey back to the front of the Formula One grid. Britain's most successful team recovered from years in the doldrums to finish fourth in the constructors' championship last season, while Carlos Sainz celebrated their first podium in five years. British driver Lando Norris, entering his second season in the sport, said: 'We have had the input into making this car, so it feels like my baby and I cannot wait to go and drive it.' The 20-year-old added: 'If I think back to this point last year, I was pooping myself. Now, I am a lot more confident, more relaxed, and that prepares me for the season ahead.' Sainz, 25, added: 'Lando and I have developed a good relationship. 'We have hopefully put together a better package, a better car, and I have the feeling everything is coming together. We have a positive momentum from last season, and we are hoping to carry that on this year.' McLaren chief executive Zak Brown said: 'It is always great to see the start of the season and the work of 800 men and women coming together to develop this beautiful race car. 'Our two drivers have brought a lot of energy to the team so credit to them - and McLaren is a fun place to be. 'These are very exciting times. We have turned the corner, we have a long way to go but I am excited for the first race in Australia.'
