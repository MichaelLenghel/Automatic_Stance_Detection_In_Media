This is the terrifying moment that a car with faulty brakes smashes head-on into the central reservation of a busy dual-carriageway. The dashcam footage was recorded by a fellow motorist in Moscow, Russia, last week. The vehicle suddenly appears from a slip-road before cruising straight across the carriageway and smashing into the metal barrier. In the video, the car with the camera on board is driving in the right-hand lane of the major road. Other drivers begin to slow down as motorists merge with the fast-moving traffic from a slip-road. But suddenly a red sedan comes hurtling into shot as it approaches the dual carriageway.  It dashes in front of the cars without any sign of slowing down before smashing head-on into the central reservation. The bonnet of the car crumples and the back-end flies into the air with the momentum. One of the passengers in the vehicle which is recording the footage lets out a piercing scream as the driver swerves to avoid making contact.  The video ends a short time later.      The driver of the vehicle who witnessed the accident said: 'The car brakes failed and luckily no one was injured. 'I went back to find out about his condition and said that we have a video of the accident if they need it.'
