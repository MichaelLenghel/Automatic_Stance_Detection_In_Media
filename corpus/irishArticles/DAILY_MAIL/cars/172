An Australian talent manager who earns $95,000 a year has shared the cost-cutting methods she swears by to help boost your bank balance. The 28-year-old Sydney music executive revealed to Mamamia she has $42,000 in savings and spends roughly $1,818 per month - excluding groceries and weekend activities. The woman's take-home pay is $5,871 a month after tax according to the Australian income tax calculator Neuvoo. After dividing her money for her regular monthly expenses including her share of the rent and internet, she splits the remaining balance into three accounts: 20 per cent into 'fire extinguisher', 10 per cent into 'smile' and  10 per cent for 'splurging'. The 'fire extinguisher' money account, which is recommend by The Barefoot Investor, is used to pay off immediate 'financial fires', such as debts and mortgages. The 'smile' account goes towards funding activities or things which make you happy such as holidays and cars. Meanwhile, the splurge account is used for everyday spending.  1. Fire extinguisher account: 20 per cent of income. Covers 'financial fires' like debts and mortgages. 2. Smile account: 10 per cent of income. Covers activities and things that make you happy like holidays and cars. 3. Splurge account: 10 per cent of income. Covers everyday spending. REMAINING MONEY GOES ON RENT AND BILLS (60 per cent).  The woman said her half of the rent (which she splits with her boyfriend) comes to $1,326 a month, while utilities, internet and transport set her back $130. Her private health insurance costs her $100.59, which is on top of her monthly index fund contribution of $100.  The woman's subscriptions to streaming services including Stan, Netflix and Spotify come to a total of $32. But she revealed that she pays minimal to exercise ($80) and instead runs in the park or completes free yoga workouts on YouTube and plays social mixed netball with her friends.

Save on pricey gyms and go for runs in the park or conduct workouts on YouTube. 2. Make your own sourdough bread and turn it into a hobby. 3. Pack lunches and always make multiple batches of food so you have multiple lunches and dinners.  4. Stay in and entertain at home as much as possible with 'budget-friendly' dishes.  She does a core workout with a free Nike Training app and regularly meditates using the Headspace app - which costs her $92 a year. The woman also cuts costs by making her own breakfast and dinner most nights at home, as well as making her own sourdough bread for the week and budget-friendly dishes.  'Making sourdough bread is one of my favourite hobbies, and it's also very cost effective – I make two loaves most Sundays and they average out to cost about $2.50 each,' she told the publication. Spending money on food is her weakness but she avoids eating out most nights of the week. In the future, she hopes to own her own apartment and 'this is the balance I'm always trying to strike with my finances', she said.
