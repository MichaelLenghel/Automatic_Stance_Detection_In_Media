This is the bizarre moment a motorist caught driving the wrong way down the A55 is forced to turn around by another driver who stops in the road. The incident was caught on camera by Kye Emmanuel, 21, on the busy road just before junction 27 St Asaph, Wales, at around 7pm, yesterday.  Dashcam footage shows approaching headlights flashing 'like mad' to presumably warn Kye of something ahead.  He manages to focus on the headlights before noticing a Land Rover slowly driving towards him with its hazard lights on.  Within a matter of seconds, Kye, of the Conwy county area, slowed and pulled over to block the carriageway as a Land Rover approaching from the wrong direction comes to a halt.  A man appears from the right corner of the dashcam and appears to shout at the Land Rover's driver, causing him to reverse his vehicle.  It is thought the 4X4 driver told him 'to get out of my way' and insisted on driving in the opposite direction twice.   He claimed that he had to turn around, but the elderly gentleman said he couldn’t.  Kye then called the police and the driver hurtled down the junction when he wasn't looking.  He then chased the vehicle until the driver left the junction and headed for the A55 east bound.  Police already received reports of careless driving and were in the process of setting up a road block as soon as they could get traffic cars to the scene, Kye claimed.     He has been working for Hough Green in Llandudno Junction, for over a year now, and passed his HGV class 1 test only last week, having been a class 2 driver beforehand.
