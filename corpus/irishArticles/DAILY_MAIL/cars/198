FRANKFURT, Feb 20 (Reuters) - German cars and trucks maker Daimler said it would revamp the management of its finance, production and development portfolios to remove duplicate layers between Mercedes-Benz and Daimler AG. As a result, Daimler's Chief Financial Officer Harald Wilhelm will take over responsibility as finance chief at Mercedes-Benz AG from April 1 and Mercedes-Benz Chief Financial Officer Frank Lindenberg will leave, the company said. Wolf-Dieter Kurz will take on responsibility for product strategy and steering at Mercedes-Benz Cars. He is currently responsible for the business cases of product projects. Daimler Chief Executive Ola Kaellenius will take over responsibility for Mercedes Vans from Wilfried Porth, who retains his role as head of human resources, Daimler said. Markus Schaefer, currently management board member for Research and Mercedes-Benz Cars development, will become chief operating officer at Daimler AG, the Stuttgart-based company said.
