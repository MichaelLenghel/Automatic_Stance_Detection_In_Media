General Motors has revealed what Holden owners can expect after the vehicle manufacturer announced the end of the iconic brand in Australia. After closing the company's local manufacturing operations in 2017, GM will 'retire' Holden in both Australia and New Zealand, axing about 600 jobs.   Holden's parent company told the ABC drivers will still have access to warranty, spare parts, servicing and recalls 'for at least the next 10 years'. GM Holden's interim managing director Kristian Aquilina told the public broadcaster those services will 'work in exactly the same way as they do today' and Holden owners won't be affected in any way.    Daniel Gardner, from WhichCar magazine, said GM has a legal obligation on after-sales promises. 'If the words of the executive team are to be trusted - and they must be, because Holden is legally obliged to support existing owners for a number of years - Holden's saying 10 years [ongoing support],' he said. 'If you own a Holden and have only just bought one, you'll be able to service it, buy parts, and there'll be after-sales care there for 10 years at least. Not a lot will change.'  Around 200 people will be kept in a job in order to transition to this new system solely for after-sales. Holden's closure will see 600 jobs cut in areas such as management, marketing and engineering.   Production on the cars ends in June - however avid fans can buy cars still in showrooms or recently coming out of the factory. It is expected no Holden cars will be available for purchase by 2021.  Holden has suffered recent crumbling domestic sales, while GM also announced plans to shut a car plant in Thailand and withdraw the Chevrolet brand from the market there. Together the two shutdowns will cost the US multinational more than $1billion. GM has pledged to provide 'fair' redundancy packages for its staff, with most to be gone by the end of June.  Ms Aquilina described the shutdown decision as 'agonising' but said the company had chased down 'every conceivable option' to keep the brand afloat. 1856 - Holden begins as a South Australian saddlery business. 1917 - Holden manufactures vehicle bodies. 1931 - General Motors buys Holden Motor Body Builders. 1948 - The FX, the first Australian-designed car, is released. 1951 - Holden's first ute goes on sale. 1958 - South Australian manufacturing plant opens at Elizabeth, though it does not assemble its first full car until 1965. 1968 - Kingswood and Monaro enter the market. 1969 - Holden makes its first V8 engine. 1971 - Holden launches the HQ model.

'We've tried to find a way to defy gravity. 'But the hard truth was there was just no way to come up with a plan that would support a competitive and growing and flourishing Holden and also provide a sufficient return to our investors. 'I'm personally convinced GM tried everything to keep Holden going.' THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S NOT HAPPY 'I am angry ... they took money from Australian taxpayers for all those years just to let the Holden brand wither on their watch - that's disappointing.' Prime Minister Scott Morrison, noting governments had contributed more than $2 billion to GM. 'Holden is walking away from Australia.' Trade Minister Karen Andrews.

Australian Manufacturing Workers' Union representative Donherra Walmsley. HOLDEN DEALERS ARE REELING 'They knew they were doing it tough but their understanding was, from the interim (Holden) CEO, that they would be working towards a bigger plan in the hope of turning it around. But obviously that is not to be. It's come as a huge blow to our dealers.' Australian Automotive Dealer Association chief Brian Savage. EVEN FORD ARE SADDENED THEIR RIVAL IS LEAVING 'All of us here at Ford Australia are saddened to hear the news that Holden will cease operations. Holden is an iconic brand that holds a special place in the heart of many Australians, and has done so much to shape the Australian automotive industry and the country.' Ford on twitter. BUT GM'S BOSS IS JUST AS SAD 'We're heartbroken ... On behalf of Holden and General Motors it has been an absolute privilege for Holden to be there with so many of you for those important experiences in life - family holidays, getting tradies to work, getting your L plates and getting your P plates. Bringing home a newborn. First jobs, last jobs.' interim Chairman and Managing Director Kristian Aquilina.  Source: AAP
