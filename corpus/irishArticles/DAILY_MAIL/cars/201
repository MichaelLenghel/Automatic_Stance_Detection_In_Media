Shocking dashcam footage has captured the moment a woman was flung into the air when she was rammed by a car at a pedestrian crossing.  The car which filmed the incident is seen slowing down and stopping at the crossing for the woman but as she walks over the road a car from the opposite direction smashes into her.  Once the woman steps on to the road, the car from the opposite direction has six seconds to react before hitting her, but doesn't appear to slow down at all.   She is lifted into the air by the impact of the car, during the incident which happened just before 9am last Friday on Burnley Road, Rawtenstall.    Other drivers can be seen getting out of their cars to come to her aid after the collision.  Lancashire Police have confirmed she suffered only minor injuries. The video was recorded by the dashcam of a driving instructor, who asked to remain anonymous.  He said he was stationary at the crossing and was on his way to pick up a pupil at the time and that the incident had left him shaken.  He said: 'I've never seen that happen before. I never thought there would be an impact - I was shaken up.  'I'm mad at myself that I didn't sound my horn.'  He said he later saw an ambulance heading towards the scene, adding: 'People from behind me and across the road got out and got her to the side of the road.'  A police spokesperson said: 'The Ambulance Service and police attended the scene and the road was closed for a short period. The paramedics gave first aid and confirmed minor injuries to the casualty's arm and leg.  'The driver was dealt with by way of a Fixed Penalty ticket for driving without due care and attention.'
