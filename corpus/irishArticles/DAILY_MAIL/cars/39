This is the shocking moment a man crashed his vehicle into a highway barrier wall in Mexico and was ejected before dying at a local hospital hours later. The accident occurred Sunday afternoon in Naucalpan, a city northwest of Mexico City, when Alan Mauricio Huerta Cortés, 25, lost control of his Mazda and collided against the concrete divider. A surveillance camera captured the horrifying moment the car hit the side of the wall and then took off in the air as Huerta Cortés simultaneously flew out of the vehicle.  Huerta Cortés' vehicle did not collide with other cars on the highway.  In the video, Huerta Cortés' body is lying and is narrowly run over by at least two cars while his mangled vehicle rests in the middle of the highway.  His body landed about 65 feet from where the wrecked vehicle landed sideways.  Several bystanders rushed to Huerta Cortés' side before paramedics arrived and placed him on a stretcher about five minutes after the accident.  According to Mexican newspaper El Universal, the head of the National Institute of Health Care, Dr. Eduardo Vazquez Celis, said Huerta Cortés suffered head and abdominal injuries as a result of not having his seat belt on at the time of the accident. Huerta Cortés was under observation in the intensive care unit before he was declared dead.    Authorities did not report any other injuries.
