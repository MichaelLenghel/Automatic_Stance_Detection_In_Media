A shocking case of road rage unfolded on a busy Sydney road after two cars tried to merge into the middle lane at the same time, sparking debate over who was in the wrong.   The incident was captured on camera at Parramatta Road, Summer Hill, in the city's inner west on Sunday afternoon.   Footage showed both cars, one in the left lane and one in the right, indicating to change lanes, before the ute moved slightly in front and took the spot. The passenger of the hatchback then opened the passenger door to yell at the ute driver, getting out of the car and smashing his hand against the window. The ute driver retaliated, driving into the hatchback's front passenger door before driving off into the distance.  Since being shared on the Dash Cam Owners Australia Facebook page on Monday night it has already been shared more than 1000 times. But drivers are divided over who was in the wrong.  Most agreed the ute had right of way to move into the centre lane as they were trying to get out of a left turning lane. 'The ute driver had an immediate reason to move over a lane. They were both indicating, but ute was first to move into the lane so fair enough for him,' one said. But drivers were critical of the way both drivers handled the situation.  'They both merged at the same time, it happens, no ones fault or anything, pointless reaction from the guy in the right lane,' one wrote.   Some suggested the driver of hatchback 'got what he deserved' for lashing out.
