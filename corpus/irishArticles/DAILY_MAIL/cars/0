This is the shocking moment an out-of-control pushchair carrying a young child rolls into traffic and almost slams into a van. A distracted mother was chatting on the phone at the side of the road in Harrow, London, when the buggy trundled away from her into cars sitting at a red light. Dashcam footage shows the pram rolling into the path of cars and heading straight into the side of a delivery van. The child's mother races toward the pram and grabs it just moments before her child bashes into the vehicle head first.  The mother managed to get to her child just in time, as seconds later the van took off as the traffic light turned green. Daniel B captured the footage on his Nextbase dashcam and was forced to beep his horn to alert the distracted mother.    He said: 'Luckily, nobody was injured and I think the mother learned a lesson that day!' 'I felt relief when she ran onto the road to grab the buggy. Before that I was mostly frustrated at her carelessness, when I realised the traffic light was amber I was certain that there was not enough time for me to jump out of the car to help. It happened very fast.' Daniel says the child was 'lucky' to have not been hurt and that his horn was 'very useful'. He said: 'In the past I have witnessed several accidents due to many miles driven, all across Europe, but none of them have been deadly so far.  'The child in this incident was very lucky. A second or so later, this video could have had a very different outcome.' 'My horn was never as useful as it was on that day.'
