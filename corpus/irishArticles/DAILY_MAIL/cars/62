A man and woman have been charged with manslaughter after the death of a three-year-old boy who was allegedly left on daycare minibus. The boy's body was found inside the vehicle parked outside Hambledon State School in Cairns, about 2km from his daycare, at 3.15pm Tuesday. He had allegedly been picked up at about 9.30am that morning. Temperatures reached 36C in Cairns that day.  'The alleged driver of the bus, a 45-year-old Bentley Park man and a 34-year-old female employee from Manunda who was also on the bus have been charged with one count each of manslaughter,' police said on Monday night.  They are due to face Cairns Magistrates Court on Tuesday.  A spokesman for Goodstart Early Learning, which operated the bus, previously told Daily Mail Australia the company was 'devastated' to learn of the child's death.  'We are working to support the entire centre team, our families and our children,' the spokesman said. 'The matter is now a police investigation and we will be working with the police, Department of Education (childhood education and care), and Workplace health and Safety. 'Our thoughts are very much with the family of the child at this time.' The centre was closed on the day after the tragedy, with an ominous sign in its car park reading 'do not leave babies and children in parked cars'.  More to come.   Children's bodies heat up three-to-five times faster than adults do The younger the child, the more vulnerable they are  On a 29C day, temperatures inside a car can reach 44C in just ten minutes This can cause 'serious injury' and brain damage After 20 minutes, the temperature reaches a fatal 60.2C, which could kill Winding down the windows or parking in the shade will do little as it doesn't affect the car's core temperature
