This is the moment an overconfident motorist tried to drive his pick-up truck through a flooded underpass and ended up floating in the road. Another motorist filmed the driver of a red Chevrolet drive past him and into the murky high water in Spartanburg in South Carolina. The filmer jokes 'Let's watch this s***,' from his position parked safely away from the water. 'He isn't gonna make it', he adds. 'There isn't no way in hell.'  The overconfident motorist continues to drive forward through the water until his vehicle begins to float when the flood becomes too deep. 'Oh he's floating buddy,' the cameraman says, as another person in the vehicle adds: 'I don't know why the hell he tried.' Moments later, a police car is seen arriving on the other side of the underpass. The clip then cuts to show the driver of the Chevrolet standing on the top of his floating truck after climbing out through a window. The nose of his truck continues to sink as he stands on the roof looking at his cell phone.  Dozens of plastic bottles are seen floating in the murky water as the flood grows outside the underpass - and cars are seen turning away on the other side. The motorist who captured the footage on February 6 said: 'A red Chevrolet passed me to go under the underpass, which was flooding.  'He got half way, and his back end started floating. He then climbed through the window to the back of truck. The truck continued to sink while I recorded.' More than 5.36 inches of rain fell in Spartanburg on February 6, according to the National Weather Service, setting a new one-day record in the area.
