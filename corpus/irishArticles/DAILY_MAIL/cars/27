Mercedes-Benz has been slammed for ignoring warnings to recall cars fitted with deadly airbags. More than 20,000 Australian drivers were told to stop driving their car immediately in 2018 because of the faulty Takata airbag - which can potentially fire shrapnel when deployed. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said Mercedes-Benz Australia failed to recall its C and E-Class vehicles despite being required to between June and November of that year. A court-enforceable undertaking has now been issued to the car manufacturer by the ACCC to recall the affected models.  'Mercedes-Benz failed to comply with its obligations to initiate recalls under the Takata compulsory recall, potentially putting the lives of drivers and passengers at risk, and failed to inform anyone of the delay,' ACCC deputy chair Delia Rickard said.   The affected cars are certain C and E class cars older than six years in Queensland, Northern Territory, Western Australia and New South Wales. Those older than nine years old in other parts of Australia are also included in the compulsory recall.  Mercedes-Benz has acknowledged the failings, caused by the availability of spare parts, the ACCC said in a statement. The manufacturer will also provide a hire car or alternative transport if the airbag is not replaced within two weeks of the customer's request.    Other cars affected by the faulty airbags include certain Honda, Toyota, Nissan, BMW, Mazda and Lexus models built between 2001 and 2004.  It is believed there have been 29 deaths and more than 320 injuries worldwide from faulty Takata alpha airbags. In the US alone, more than 40 million cars were affected and the global recall is the largest in automotive  history.   The ACCC's undertaking includes further details of the cars recalled.  Audi - certain models between 2005-2011 BMW - certain models between 2001-2017 Cadilla - Cadillac Escalade 2007-2014 Chrysler - certain models between 2005-2015 Citroen - certain models between 2009-2016 Dodge - certain models between 2004-2010 Ferrari - certain models between 2008-2013 Ford - certain models between 2004-2017 General Motors Chevrolet - certain models between 2007-2008 Holden - certain models between 2006-2018  Honda  - certain models between 2001-2015 Jaguar Land Rover - certain models between 2007-2016 Lexus - certain models between 2000-2014   Mazda - certain models between 2002-2015 McLaren - certain models between 2012-2018 Mercedes-Benz - certain models between 2005-2017 Mercedes-Benz Vans - certain models between 2006-2017  Mitsubishi - certain models between 2003-2017 Mustang Australia - Ford Mustang between 2006-2014 Nissan - certain models between 2001-2016 Performax - certain models between 2014-2018 Subaru - certain models between 2004-2014 Tesla - Tesla Model S between 2014-2016 Toyota - certain models between 2000-2016 Volkswagen - certain models between 2006-2016 Motorcycles -  Honda GL1800 Goldwing between 2008-2015  Full breakdown of recalled cars can be found at Product Safety Australia
