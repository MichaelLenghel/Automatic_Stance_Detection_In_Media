Car owners in 20 UK areas have been warned that their region will be targeted by authorities hunting for untaxed vehicles in the coming weeks. The the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency has named and shamed the locations where it took nearly 600,000 enforcement actions against keepers of motors without tax in 2019. And it has confirmed it will be on the prowl in these destinations in the coming week, armed and ready with wheel clamps. The DVLA listed the 20 regions - topped by Belfast with 78,501 enforcement actions last year for untaxed vehicles - it will concentrate on as part of a new campaign. Birmingham, Glasgow, Manchester and Sheffield have also been identified as locations of high importance based on the number of enforcement last year.  1. Belfast - 78,501 2. Birmingham - 61,531 3. Glasgow - 34,375 4. Manchester - 34,106 5. Sheffield - 30,467 6. South London - 29,336 7. Cardiff - 28,857 8. Nottingham - 26,134 9. East London - 26,005 10. Edinburgh - 24,779 11. North London - 24,766 12. Bristol - 24,747 13. Coventry - 23,739 14. Peterborough - 23,271 15. Leicester - 23,174 16. Newcastle - 22,996 17. Northampton - 18,729 18. Romford - 18,325 19. Swansea - 18,237 20. Doncaster - 17,885 Source: DVLA  You can check if your area is among the list of 20 regions with the worst record in 2019 for unpaid tax-related fines and penalties - and therefore being more heavily patrolled - in our list (right). The campaign comes after growing evidence that vehicle tax evasion has soared since the paper disc was abolished over five years ago. Around 1.2million individual enforcement actions - from late licensing penalties, out of court settlements and wheel clamping - were taken for untaxed vehicles in total in 2019, the DVLA confirmed last month. That compares to 693,270 in 2013 - the final full term when owners had to display paper tax discs. This was another reminder to the Government that the decision to move vehicle excise duty online has backfired, with lost revenue for car tax evasion estimated to be costing the Treasury £94million a year. Failure to tax a vehicle can escalate to a fine of £1,000 for motorists who ignore penalties and the case goes to court - and the DVLA has the power to clamp cars until the correct amount is paid. If motorists are caught without tax, they'll receive an automated letter and a fine of £80 will be sent to the registered address. This is reduced by 50 per cent if paid within 28 days – but drivers don't get points on their licence. Since paper tax discs were abolished on 1 October 2014, it's believed the overall cost to the government is closer to £300million. To clampdown - quite literally - on offenders, the DVLA has hatched a plan to go after motorists in areas where vehicle tax evasion is most prevalent. It said almost 590,000 enforcement actions were taken in the 20 worst regions - and this is where they will concentrate efforts.   This will involve penalties and fines for evaders, and could result in clamping and owners ultimately losing their cars altogether.  When DVLA clamps an untaxed vehicle the driver is charged a £100 release fee.  If they cannot show that the vehicle has been taxed when it is released the motorist will have to pay a surety fee of £160.  This is refunded if the motorists can show the vehicle has been taxed within 15 days. If the release fee is not paid within 24 hours, DVLA will impound the car and the fee rises to £200.  There is also a storage charge of £21 per day that the motor is held.  Again, a surety fee of £160 must be paid if the motorist cannot show that the vehicle has been taxed. As it already does for all vehicle tax evasion enforcement, the agency will use its own VED database to identify any cars in these 20 locations that are being driven without having tax and punish owners retrospectively. DVLA enforcement teams will also be on the road in vehicles specially equipped with automatic number plate recognition cameras. The cameras can rapidly run the details of any motor that it snaps against the VED database to find out if it is being driven without tax, or wrongly declared as SORN and off the road. The teams will be able to take immediate action and clamp or impound cars.   Julie Lennard. chief executive at the DVLA, said: 'The number of untaxed vehicles on the road is falling, but we are determined to reduce this even further.  'We operate a range of measures to make vehicle tax easy to pay and hard to avoid, so there really is no excuse if you fail to tax your vehicle.  'While the vast majority of motorists do the right thing and tax correctly, this campaign highlights the real consequences that motorists face if they don’t tax their vehicles. ' RAC spokesman Simon Williams welcomed the targeted scheme, claiming that 'high-profile enforcement campaigns like this are needed to make sure the consequences of not doing so are fully understood'.  He added: 'This DVLA campaign gives a very clear warning of the action that will be taken on untaxed vehicles. Having your vehicle clamped is expensive and inconvenient so it’s far simpler to make sure you tax it.'  Motorists can go online, 24 hours a day, to tax a vehicle or check whether their vehicle tax is up to date.
