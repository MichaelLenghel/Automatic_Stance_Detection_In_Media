A woman has been caught red-handed vandalising a $110,000 Tesla by the electric car's very own motion sensor cameras. The incident was captured at about 2pm on Sunday at the Westfield Shopping Centre in Penrith in Sydney's western suburbs.  The disgruntled shopper is seen strolling past the car wearing pyjama bottoms before dragging her keys along the side of the car then walking away.  The car belongs to Darren Pearce who spoke exclusively to Daily Mail Australia about the vandalism.  He said it took all of five minutes to discover the culprit had been caught on camera.  'I think all nice cars are at risk of being vandalised, probably all cars in general really, it’s just that if you vandalise a Tesla you’re going to get filmed,' he said.  Mr Pearce was at the centre for about two and a half hours before the car was vandalised.   The video has been shared more than 5,000 times and it's believed the pyjama clad perpetrator has already been identified by citizen sleuths. Footage of the incident has been passed to New South Wales Police for investigation.
