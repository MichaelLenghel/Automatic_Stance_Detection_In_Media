LJUBLJANA, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Slovenian business sentiment rose to a 6-month high in February as sentiment in the retail and manufacturing sectors improved significantly, the statistics office said on Monday. The sentiment reached 5.1 points versus 4 points in January and was the highest since August 2019. However, it was well below the 9 points reached in February 2019. "In manufacturing ... the indicators of the stocks of finished products and the overall order books improved," the office said, adding that expected sales and volume of stocks also improved in the retail sector. Confidence in construction, services and among consumers worsened slightly in February. Analysts said the movement of the sentiment in the coming months will largely depend on the developments of global trade conflicts as Slovenia is export-oriented and sells about 80% of its production abroad, mostly to other EU states. Main exports include cars, car parts, pharmaceutical products and household appliances. (Reporting by Marja Novak, editing by Ed Osmond)
