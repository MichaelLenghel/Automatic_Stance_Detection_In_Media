ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) - A fourth member of a family visiting Florida from Massachusetts has died after a four-vehicle crash earlier this week, the Florida Highway Patrol said. Jackson Smith, 11, died Wednesday at a central Florida hospital, highway patrol Lt. Kim Montes said. The crash happened Tuesday in Kissimmee, which is near Orlando. Troopers said the family had been traveling in a van when it was struck from behind and overturned. Scarlett Smith, 5, Julie Smith, 41, and Josephine Fay, 76, died at the scene, Montes said in an accident report. The Smith family is from Whitman, Massachusetts, and the Fays are from South Weymouth, Massachusetts. Two other children - Shalie Smith, 10, and Skyler Smith, 5 - were not injured in the crash. But the report said they were taken to the hospital for monitoring. Driver Shane Smith, 43, and passenger William Fay, 76, were taken to an Orlando hospital in stable condition. The family's van was traveling in traffic on State Road 429 when it was rear-ended by a pickup truck. The impact caused the van to turn over. Two other cars were involved, but no one else was injured. The report said charges are pending against the pickup truck's driver Lucas Dos Reis Laurindo, 26, of Kissimmee. An investigation continues.
