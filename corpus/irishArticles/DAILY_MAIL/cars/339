Sam Armytage has blasted Australians for complaining about the collapse of Holden but doing nothing to support the iconic car brand. The Sunrise host accused everyday Australians of directly contributing to Holden's demise after General Motors revealed it would 'retire' the brand forever this year.  'For everybody out there saying "We love Holdens", why didn't they buy Holdens? Then we wouldn't be in this problem,' Armytage said on Tuesday morning.  'It is sad... but they've got no one to blame but themselves,' agreed co-host David Koch.  Despite receiving billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies over many decades to keep its manufacturing afloat, GM showed little loyalty to the Australian government. Prime Minister Scott Morrison slammed the American car giant on Monday after being given just three minutes' notice of the decision to axe the Holden brand. 'I am angry – they let the brand wither away on their watch,' he told reporters. Ms Armytage jumped to the defence of Mr Morrison after he was criticised for using taxpayers' money to support the failing company. 'I saw today that everyone was blaming ScoMo,' she said. 'But how is it his fault? It is an American company that has been given more chances than Phar Lap. 'And for all the people grimacing about Holden, they are not driving them now.'    After closing the company's local manufacturing operations in 2017, GM announced on Monday it would retire the brand in both Australia and New Zealand.  GM will not just axe the Holden name but also stop selling cars in Australia. Holden has suffered recent crumbling domestic sales, while GM also announced plans to shut a car plant in Thailand and withdraw the Chevrolet brand from the market there.    Together the two shutdowns will cost the US multinational more than $1billion. GM has pledged to provide 'fair' redundancy packages for its 600 staff members left in limbo, with most to be gone by the end of June.  Ms Aquilina described the shutdown decision as 'agonising' but said the company had chased down 'every conceivable option' to keep the brand afloat. 'Every strategy, every plan, we looked under every rock,' he said on Monday. 'We've tried to find a way to defy gravity. 'But the hard truth was there was just no way to come up with a plan that would support a competitive and growing and flourishing Holden and also provide a sufficient return to our investors. 'I'm personally convinced GM tried everything to keep Holden going.'   Holden's parent company told the ABC drivers will still have access to warranty, spare parts, servicing and recalls 'for at least the next 10 years'. GM Holden's interim managing director Kristian Aquilina told the public broadcaster those services will 'work in exactly the same way as they do today' and Holden owners won't be affected in any way.    Daniel Gardner, from WhichCar magazine, said GM has a legal obligation on after-sales promises. 'If the words of the executive team are to be trusted - and they must be, because Holden is legally obliged to support existing owners for a number of years - Holden's saying 10 years [ongoing support],' he said. 'If you own a Holden and have only just bought one, you'll be able to service it, buy parts, and there'll be after-sales care there for 10 years at least. Not a lot will change.'  Around 200 people will be kept in a job in order to transition to this new system solely for after-sales. Holden's closure will see 600 jobs cut in areas such as management, marketing and engineering.   Production on the cars ends in June - however avid fans can buy cars still in showrooms or recently coming out of the factory.

Bringing home a newborn. First jobs, last jobs.' interim Chairman and Managing Director Kristian Aquilina.  Source: AAP
