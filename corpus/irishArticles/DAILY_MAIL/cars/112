A lorry driver has been jailed after taking the wrong exit and doing a U-turn on the M6 during rush hour, police said.    CCTV footage shows the HGV swerving right across an M6 exit before driving along the slip road the wrong way down.      The truck manages to avoid hitting oncoming cars at around 7.51am on January 21. Within a matter of seconds, the HGV grinds to a halt on the road, in the clip shared by Staffordshire Police. Moments later, the lorry can be seen attempting a U-turn on to the M6 and facing cars driving past. It edges towards the inside lane, as though it is trying to leave the slip road, before moving backwards. The HGV then swiftly turns and drives along the M6. Police said the driver received a six-month jail sentence and was disqualified from driving for 15 months.    A Staffordshire Police spokesman said: 'Imagine this on your morning commute.  'The driver of this lorry was jailed for six months and disqualified from driving for 15 months after he was caught driving dangerously on the M6 Toll last month. Thankfully, no one was injured.'  No one was injured during the incident.      Under the Highway Code, drivers must not 'stop on the carriageway, hard shoulder, slip road, central reservation or verge except in an emergency, or when told to do so by the police, traffic officers in uniform, an emergency sign or by flashing red light signals'.  Staffordshire Police have been approached for comment.
