Firefighters in Ohio made a grisly discover on Wednesday morning after a burning body was found in grassland next to railway tracks.  When emergency workers in Cleveland reached the the scene of the small fire in the city’s Collinwood neighborhood, they found the body was missing its head, hands and feet.  The dismembered body had been burned so badly that it was not even possible to determine the gender, let alone make any kind of positive identification. Sgt. Jennifer Ciaccia of Cleveland police say they have so far been unable to determine how the person died and have not revealed if they have any leads or suspects in the case according to Cleveland.com.  The gruesome find was made just after 4am following a call from a nearby resident who contacted the police. The body was found on a small path between some homes that led to railway tracks.  Some foliage had also been placed on top of the corpse in an attempt to ensure the body burned faster.  Cleveland homicide detectives are investigating, according to Fox 8.  The area where the body was found is notorious for burnt out cars being dumped and one such car was found 20ft away from victim.  Police had also been to the area on Friday night after the victim of an armed robbery told police that his Find My iPhone app was directing cops to the same location, although no phone was ever recovered.
