A brick wall was knocked to the ground after being hit by the gale force winds of Storm Dennis as it battered London.  Footage shows trees swaying in the 75mph winds outside a property in Elephant and Castle, London, at around 2am, on February 16. Within a few seconds, a wall comes crashing towards the pavement and sends bricks flying across the partially empty street. The wall's trellis was pulled off the top and is seen scattered near a parked car and motorbikes.   Moments later, the clip shows the aftermath of the incident with a property's door step and pavement covered in crumbled bricks. It comes as Storm Dennis has wreaked havoc since making landfall in Britain with hundreds of flights cancelled and trains delayed. It is feared to have claimed a fifth victim after a woman was swept away by floodwater in Worcestershire, this week.   More than 40,000 were affected by travel disruption - with thousands evacuated from their homes over the weekend. Britain saw more than a month's worth of rainfall in 48 hours and coastlines buffeted by 90mph winds.   Five 'danger to life' warnings are included in the 488 Environment Agency flood warnings in place, today.     CrossCountry, Great Western Railway, Merseyrail, Northern, South Western Railway, Transport for Wales and Scotrail services are affected.
