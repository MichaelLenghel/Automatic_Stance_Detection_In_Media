A rare Ferrari F40 worth £1million has been destroyed after it burst into flames on the streets of Monte Carlo.  The Italian sportscar, which can reach speeds of 228mph, sent towering plumes of smoke into the sky after the back of the vehicle ignited in the city in Monaco. It is one of 1,311 F40s made from the late 1980s to early 1990s, which are among the fastest cars on the road. Scroll down for video Shocking pictures show tongues of flame leaping out of the back of the classic car as it slowly melts on the streets of Monte Carlo. Dark black smoke is also seen rising into the sky from the burning model, which has the right-side door left open. One bystander even tried to rescue the vehicle by spraying the flames with water from a garden hose.  A later picture shows the car as a melted and blackened wreck after firefighters manage to douse the flames. It is then shown being taken away on a tow truck.  It is unclear whether the car was been driven shortly before it caught fire. There are no reported injuries. Former Grand Prix motorcycle racer Max Biaggi posted a heartbreaking video on social media lamenting the loss of the prize vehicle, after he saw it burst into flames near his home.  Mr Biaggi had been preparing to travel to Jerez de la Frontera, Spain, to take part in Moto3 tests at the city's race track. The flaming scene was filmed by Instagrammer smih_carspotting two days ago with a caption showing a praying symbol and crying face. MailOnline has contacted Ferrari for comment.
