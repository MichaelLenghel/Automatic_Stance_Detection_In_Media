A nine-year-old schoolgirl was forced to hide in bushes after being stalked by a middle-aged man driving a van.  Kayra Oz said she was on her way to school at 7.50am on Friday in the Perth suburb of Atwell when the van pulled up beside her - just 700 metres from her house.  'My shoelace was untied, I went to go tie it up and there was this silver van in front of me and he asked me "do you want me to give you a ride?",' Kayra told 9 News.  Kayra said she hid in bushes on Brenchly Drive.  'I was really scared - he got out of the car and started looking for me,' she said.  The girl's mother, Tulay Oz, said when her daughter told her about the incident she was shocked and her heart was racing.  She quickly sent out a warning to other parents on social media.  The man was driving a silver courier type van and is described as in his 50s, has olive skin, dark hair with grey flecks, stubble, and a foreign accent.  He was wearing grey shorts and black t-shirt.  It is not the first time Kayra has been targeted.  She said another incident happened on corner of Folland Parade and Jakovich Circuit in the same suburb a month ago.  On this occasion she was walking home from school at about 6pm when a different van stopped.  'There was this white van and [the driver] asked me if i wanted some lollies,' Kayra said.  Daily Mail Australia has contacted WA Police and the Department of Education WA for comment.
