A rare wedge-tailed eagle named Aquila has been rescued after it became waterlogged and unable to fly during torrential rain. The endangered bird was saved at 11pm on Wednesday on the Sunshine Coast as more than 200mm of rainfall hit the region in just a few hours.  Wildlife Rescue Sunshine Coast posted photos of the giant raptor on social media. 'We are in the middle of torrential rain here on the Sunshine Coast,' the post read. 'This poor totally water logged Wedge tail needed rescuing. When we eventually got home, we were flooded! This land of extremes! At least it’s a dry night now for soggy Aquila.' After a night inside, it was reported the bird was still damp but 'looking magnificent' on Thursday morning.  Aquila will be released once he's completely dry. The wild weather is caused by category-two Tropical Cyclone Uesi, which is expected to produce huge swells, high tides and wild winds as it moves south along the nation's east coast.  Emergency services have been scrambling as heavy rain and large swells up to five metres threaten to hammer Queensland from Thursday, which forecasters say could produce more flooding and beach erosion.
