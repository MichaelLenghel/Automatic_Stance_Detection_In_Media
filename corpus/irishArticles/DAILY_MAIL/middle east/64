Police are ramping up efforts to find a man who sexually assaulted a young woman after following her from a suburban Melbourne bus stop. The 23-year-old woman was waiting at a Doncaster East bus stop on the morning of 27 January when a man who she did not know sat beside her. The woman walked away but was followed by the man, who sexually assaulted her, exposed himself and then walked off down a Maggs Street, near the corner of Blackburn Road. He is described as being Middle Eastern in appearance, about 165-175 centimetres tall with a medium build, brown beard and moustache. He was wearing a hoodie, navy blue shorts that appeared to be splattered with paint or plaster and work boots with no laces. Police will on Tuesday hand out flyers on local bus routes in an effort to identify the perpetrator. "Even if you think it's insignificant, the smallest detail can often be the breakthrough we need," Transit Senior Sergeant Michele Clooney said in a statement. "Too many sexual offences unfortunately go unreported on the public transport network, often for a range of reasons, but we need the community to understand that any unwanted sexual behaviour is a crime and will be taken seriously by police."
