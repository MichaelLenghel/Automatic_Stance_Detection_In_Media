A team of U.S Customs and Border Protection agents and officers from the Laredo Police Department rescued at least 37 migrants from a stash house in Laredo, Texas. A female migrant called the police last Thursday stating that she and the rest of the group were being held hostage inside a home a street away from Memorial Middle School. According to CBP, Laredo cops and Border Patrol officers conducted a welfare check of the migrants at the safe house near Springfield Avenue and East Fremont Street. The Laredo Morning Times reported that CBP had not identified any suspects connected with the kidnapping of the undocumented migrants. All of the individuals, children included, previously unlawfully crossed the Mexico-United States border and were taken into custody by CBP to be processed. CBP said the migrants were natives of Guatemala and Mexico. The stash house was the sixth to be discovered in the Laredo area during the last five weeks. More than 100 undocumented immigrants had been removed from the homes by CBP and local police during that stretch.   At least 73 migrants from El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Nicaragua and Honduras were rescued from three stash houses from January 13 to January 30. The homes are mostly used by human traffickers as a means to secure the migrants once they are successfully smuggled across the 1,954-mile Mexico-United States border.  The migrants are subsequently moved to other cities or released from captivity once their family members pay their smuggling fees. Since October 1, 2019, Rio Grande Valley Sector Border Patrol agents have discovered and arrested more than 350 illegal aliens in nearly 30 human smuggling stash houses.
