A homicidal father who set fire to a car with his children and estranged wife inside tried to stop bystanders from rescuing them as they burned to death, before stabbing himself in the chest when he knew his evil deed was done.  Rowan Charles Baxter, 42, killed Aaliyah, six, Laianah, four, and Trey, three, by dousing them in petrol and setting them alight at Camp Hill, in Brisbane's south-east, at about 8.20am on Wednesday.  Hannah Baxter managed to escape the burning Kia Sportage but was scolded so badly her skin was melting off and she looked like 'someone in a war movie' as she tried to rescue her children. The 31-year-old repeatedly screamed 'my children are in the car, save my children' as shocked neighbours tried to douse the flames, Daily Mail Australia has been told.   But as fire took hold of the car, the 42-year-old killer was hell-bent on ensuring his kids would die. He demanded locals stop trying to put out the flames - and insisted they didn't attempt to pull the children free. Aaron Snell, a neighbour who witnessed the tragedy, said Baxter shouted at would-be rescuers and told them he wanted his family to die. 'He was so angry and just going absolutely crazy... he wanted [the car] to burn,' he told News Corp. The monster got his wish. The three young siblings died at the scene, while Ms Baxter was taken to Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital clinging to life.  She died of her injuries early on Wednesday night.  The shocking murder-suicide that has left Australia reeling unfolded just metres from the home of Ms Baxter's parents on Raven Street, Camp Hill, as she drove her children to school.  The couple broke up late last year after more than a decade together. They were locked in a custody battle after Ms Baxter moved to the property with the children.  On Thursday morning, Mrs Baxter's brother and her sister-in-law slammed her 'disgusting' killer. In a moving Instagram post, her brother Nathaniel Clarke said he had recently reconnected with her and revealed she had told family she was looking forward to a 'great' year.  'Yesterday I had my sister, nephew and two nieces taken from me in the worst way possible by a heartless monster they called their dad,' Mr Clarke wrote. 'Everyone who has been lucky enough to be a part of their lives would know just how sweet and loving these kids and my sister really were.  'The last thing my sister said to my wife was 'I'm so excited this year will be great'.  Mr Clarke said his parents had 'given everything they own' to fund his sister's custody battle with her killer.  He added: 'I'm so grateful she and I got to reconnect and become such close friends before this tragedy. I will forever love you all.'   JANUARY, 2020 Queensland Police officers are called to a family violence incident that allegedly involved the couple. WEDNESDAY FEBRUARY 19 - EARLY MORNING: Rowan Charles Baxter, 42, is spotted filling a jerry can with fuel at a local service station.  8.20AM:    Baxter dives into his estranged wife Hannah Clarke's white Kia Sportage as she was preparing to do the school drop off on Raven Street, Camp Hill, a wealthy suburb of Brisbane. He douses Ms Clarke, 31, and their three children - Aaliyah, six, Laianah, four, and Trey, three - in petrol and sets the car alight.  Neighbours hear an explosion which sounded like a 'gas bottle' blast. At least four explosions followed.  Baxter grabs a knife from the SUV and stabs himself in the chest. He tries to stop neighbours from saving his wife and children before dying in the street. Ms Clarke escapes the burning car and screams: 'He's poured petrol on me.'  Horrified witnesses see her skin peeling off her body. One heroic neighbour hoses her down in an attempt to save her life and suffers burns himself.  She is rushed to Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital in a critical condition.    WEDNESDAY NIGHT: Ms Clarke dies in hospital from the horrendous burns she suffered in the quadruple murder suicide. Mr Clarke's wife Stacey also slammed Baxter in the wake of the savage murder-suicide, calling him a 'monster'. She said Ms Baxter's parents, Sue and Lloyd, had 'exhausted themselves to try and help Hannah escape this monster'. 'My beautiful sister in-law and my nieces and nephew had their lives taken by a disgusting human being they called their father,' Mrs Clarke wrote in a fundraiser to help cover funeral costs.    Neighbours from the old family home 3km away in Carindale told Daily Mail Australia the kids hadn't been to visit their father much since the separation.  Baxter took the marriage breakdown badly and was living as a virtual recluse with his dog at the former family home.  In the backyard a basketball lay on the grass and children's clothes and bed linen were hung on the clothesline, which a next-door neighbour said had been left there for weeks.   Before the separation, neighbours described a happy family, with the sounds of the children playing in the backyard often filling the air.  'They seemed like a nice happy family. He was always polite and said hello,' one said.  'We would see them walk the kids to school and daycare up the road.'  Queensland Police officers were called to a family violence incident that allegedly involved the couple just last month, the Courier Mail reported.  But neighbours said they never heard any fights or even either of the couple yelling at their children.  The happy relationship of the past is a far cry from what witnesses experienced on Wednesday morning.  One woman who lived right in front of where the car exploded said she came out of her house to be confronted with 'a man and a woman on fire'.  'I thought it was a car accident, you don't really think that someone could do [what Baxter did]. The fire was intense, you could feel the heat radiating off it,' she said.  Ms Baxter first yelled 'he poured petrol on me', before her anguished thoughts turned to her children inside the burning vehicle.  'She was screaming ''my kids are in the car, save my kids'' over and over,' she told Daily Mail Australia.  Heroic neighbour Michael Zemek, who was washing his car over the road, ran to help and is still recovering in hospital after suffering serious burns himself.  Family killer Rowan Baxter uploaded a video to his Facebook page a year before he burned his entire family to death in a sick murder-suicide showing his middle daughter expressing her unconditional love for him. Baxter's 'little middle' Laianah scooped up her mother's phone to record a heartfelt message for her father while he was stuck at work.  'Hi Dad I miss you. I miss you at work,' the young girl said before appearing to struggle for control of the phone with her elder sister. 'I miss you so much and love you so, so much.'  Baxter wrote alongside the video: 'Found this on my wife's phone, my little middle missing her daddy at work.' 'Priceless words before the older one jumps in to take over then listen to @hannbaxter in the background. 'Classic Baxter household antics.' Little over a year later, he would kill Laianah, her two siblings and their mother in cold blood.   The witness said he got Ms Baxter to roll on the ground until the flames were out, then sprayed the burns across her whole body with water.  Another neighbour, Andrew Sinclair, heard the explosion and came running, arriving to see Ms Baxter's piercing gaze as two neighbours hosed her down.  'She was standing with her arms out and her palm towards the hose. She looked straight at me, staring,' he told Daily Mail Australia.  'It was a look of pain and shock that will stay with me forever.'  Mr Sinclair likened the burns across her entire body to the famous photo of a burned girl in the Vietnam War.  'She was dressed in active wear like a typical suburban mum and it was burnt, there was holes in it and her skin was falling off her body,' he said.  'She was burned all over her body. It was like someone you'd see in a war movie. She was only still standing because of adrenaline, the pain she must have been in was unimaginable.'  Mr Sinclair said the fire was so intense he couldn't even tell what kind of car it was.  'No matter what the fire brigade did they couldn't get the fire out, there was no chance to save those kids,' he said.  'I can't understand why he would do this. Even if he didn't love his family anymore there's his parents, brothers, cousins who have to carry this with them forever.'   Another witness said the car rolled down the road with Baxter chasing after it. He then jumped into the burning car and grabbed a knife.  'He stabbed himself in the chest and then he fell,' a young woman whose house the car stopped in front of said.  'You couldn't hear or see anything from inside the car, it was over for those kids so fast. It's the most horrible thing I've ever seen.' Baxter's charred remains were hours later loaded into the back of a funeral van by police, alongside those of his three children.  The beloved young mother's death shocked the street and the community where she ran a gym with her husband until it closed in December.  She had grown up nearby and was well known and loved among locals.  Ms Baxter was once school captain at Whites Hill State College at the end of the street, where a younger classmate said she was like a 'big sister'.  'Hannah took me under her wing, walked me to school and made sure the other kids didn't mess with me,' Lauren said.  'She was a lively, bubbly fun-loving girl, always happy, I never saw her angry.'  Ms Baxter was the DJ at blue light discos at the school and competed in swimming carnivals and cross country races.  Lauren's mother Lisa said she saw Ms Baxter at the local shops on Saturday, and regretted not catching up with her because she was already talking to someone else.
