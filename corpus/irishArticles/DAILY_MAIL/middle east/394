The terrifying moment a shark bites down on an expensive boat has been caught on camera. The video was posted on social media and showed a large mako shark biting down on the outer rim of the boat in the middle of the ocean off the coast of New Zealand. Marine biologist and shark scientist Riley Elliot, also known as 'The Shark Man', can be heard saying 'what are you doing, mate?' to the beast, prompting it to release its jaws before submerging itself beneath the surface. After the camera stopped rolling, the shark cruised around and waited for the crew to react, Caters reported. But the 35-year-old used his extensive marine knowledge to jump in and swim with the shark afterwards. Mr Riley was doing research for his PhD with his fiance and an underwater cinematographer when the shark struck.  Mr Elliot said he wasn't scared because he knew the bite wouldn't sink the boat.  The video prompted a range of responses on social media. 'Is it biting the boat to sus out what it is?' one social media user asked. Mr Riley replied:' Yeah basically.'  'Those colors of blue look unreal. Promise this had no filter used?' another wrote. 'No filter,' promised Mr Riley.  'This is amazing!! Love our sea life,' shared someone else. Mako sharks, also known as sharp-nosed mackerel sharks range throughout tropical and temperate seas.  They are as dangerous to humans as great white sharks.  Mako sharks are known for their fighting qualities and repeated leaps out of the water.  They are streamlined and relatively slender and have pointed snouts, crescent-shaped tails, and long slender.  The largest adults are around 4.5 metres in length and weigh more than 500kg.    Source: Britannica
