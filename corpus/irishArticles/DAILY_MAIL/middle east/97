Middle order bat Matt Short is on the verge of a superb counter-attacking century, having helped lift Victoria out of trouble on day one of their Sheffield Shield match against Queensland at the Gabba. Short reached 98 not out at tea to leave the Vics 5-216. The visitors recovered from a shaky 5-100 thanks to the No.5 and wicketkeeper Seb Gotch (31 not out). Short was felled earlier in his innings by nasty blow flush on the shoulder from quick Billy Stanlake but recovered after treatment. He hit 17 boundaries to score at nearly a run a ball throughout his innings only to show caution in the final overs before tea as his second first class century loomed. Inexperienced paceman Xavier Bartlett starred for the home taking 3-42, while Cameron Gannon collected 2-63. The Vics posted 44 for the opening wicket before losing 3-8 during a rain-marred first session. Debutant Jonathan Merlo (4) hit a boundary from the second ball he faced in first-class cricket before being bowled by Bartlett's follow-up delivery. Opener Travis Dean made 34, while Peter Handscomb (15) and Jake Fraser-McGurk (16) were dismissed during the middle session.
