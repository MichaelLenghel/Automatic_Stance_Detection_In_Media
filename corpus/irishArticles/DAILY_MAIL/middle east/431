A group of divers ticked off another item from their bucket lists as they filmed the jaw-dropping moment when up to 50 feeding sharks came out to play.  Video filmed by one diver, David Hobbs from Dublin, shows an instructor holding a crate in the middle of a frenzy of Caribbean reef, nurse, and tiger sharks.  He is seen opening the crate and releasing a fish every so often, which the ferocious predators quickly snap up as they circle him for more. The group comes within inches of the sharks, which - despite their reputation for aggression - playfully dart about the tourists off the coast of The Bahamas. David, who went on a dive organised by Stuart Cove's Dive Bahamas, captured the footage during one of 14 dives he did whilst in the Caribbean. Shark dives are just one of the services provided by the Nassau-based Stuart Cove's, including normal scuba diving, snorkelling, and SNUBA diving.   He said 'it was amazing to witness a shark feeding frenzy with sharks everywhere you looked', before calling the 'amazing experience' a 'bucket list thing'.
