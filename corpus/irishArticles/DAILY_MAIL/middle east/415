They're moving forward with a new schedule to best suit their little girl.  Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum finalized an 'official parenting schedule' for their six-year-old daughter Everly as part of their custody agreement following their official divorce in November. The acting duo will split their time with Everly 'right down the middle' with joint custody 'pursuant to a 2-2-5' parenting schedule, according to TMZ.  Legal documents show that Jenna will get Everly Monday through Wednesday, while Channing will be on Dad duty Wedneday through Friday. The former couple — who met while filming their hit dancing movie Step Up in 2006 —  will alternate weekends. A Parenting Plan Coordinator will be available for use if the pair choose to make any custodial schedule changes due to their unique work commitments. Channing and Jenna agreed to alternate holidays every year, with each parent receiving 10 days of 'exclusive summer vacation time.' The parents decided to 'split the day' when it comes to celebrating Everly's birthday, unless a joint celebration is agreed upon.  Jenna recently received approval from the courts to have her name legally changed back to Dewan. Jenna and Channing called it quits on their nearly nine-year marriage in April 2018 and only recently finalized their divorce in November. They also agreed to not use their daughter in social media posts which could earn profits, unless approved by the other parent. Channing has since moved on to date musician Jessie J, while Jenna is expecting another little one with her boyfriend Steve Kazee.
