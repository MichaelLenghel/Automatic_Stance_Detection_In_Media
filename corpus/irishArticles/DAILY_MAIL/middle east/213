Captivating photographs appear to show a family of baby brown bears dancing together in a forest in Finland.  Two of the young male bears and one female were seen gathering together, and appeared to be holding each others' hands and moving in a circle. At just a few months old, the young animals appear to be dancing, tapping their feet and moving to the sound of music. The cubs' mother was relaxing behind a tree as her offspring played together and fought 'just like small children' in eastern Finland near Suomussalmi.  After a while, one of the baby bears was left standing alone appearing to do a victory jig while, in another image, another baby bear escaped up a tree.   PE teacher Valtteri Mulkahainen was lucky enough to witness the magical moment and captured it on his camera which he uses as a hobby. The 52-year-old was travelling through eastern Finland when they came across the bears near Suomussalmi. He was exploring the Finnish taiga - a boreal forest - around the town of Martinselkonen when he came to a clearing and noticed a mother bear, who was then joined by the group of cubs. Valtteri, from Sotkamo in east Finland, said: 'When I saw them standing on their hind legs I thought I was imagining it.           'It seemed like I was in the middle of the magic forest in a fairy tale. 'If the bears began to sing I probably wouldn't have been surprised because it was so unusual to watch.'  According to Valtteri, the bears were constantly fighting and playing with each other 'just like small children' as he watched nearby.   While the mother bear was eating, her children were constantly fighting while standing on their hind legs and tumbling to the ground.   They would stand and face each other in a circle and start pushing and biting as if they were dancing. Their mother would always be present and watched closely in case other bears came close to them. Valtteri said: 'There are four cubs, but one is missing as the instructor said he was born very weak and probably did not survive. 'It was interesting to observe that they are all different in character - some were bullies and others avoided fights and were calm. 'Most of their scenes are reminiscent of characters from fairy tales about bears where all the bears walk on their hind legs and twist dance. 'It wasn't scary because the photographs were taken from a small cottage so security was guaranteed.'  Valtteri has photographed bears over many years and posted them on his Facebook page.
