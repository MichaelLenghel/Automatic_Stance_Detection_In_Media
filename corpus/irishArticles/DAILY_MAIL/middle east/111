This is the shocking moment thugs drop-kick a homeless man and repeatedly stamp on him outside a McDonald's. Abdifathi Ibrahim, 20, was one of the men in the group of four who carried out the unprovoked attack in the middle of the day in Horsefair, Bristol city centre.  CCTV shows one of the thugs grab the victim as Ibrahim jumps on a rubbish bin and then launches himself off it to carry out the drop-kick.  The man then falls to the ground as the four attackers continue stamping on his head and body. The attack carries on for around 15 seconds and a woman approaches the group in an attempt to calm the violence. The men then walk away from the scene as the homeless man is left writhing in pain on the floor, clutching his stomach. Ibrahim was jailed on Thursday for four and a half years by Judge Euan Ambrose at Bristol Crown Court. He pleaded guilty to the attack, which happened on March 4 last year. Another man and two youths who appear in the video have been 'dealt with separately', according to The Sun.  Prosecutor James Haskell told the court it was pure luck that the victim was not seriously hurt from the incident. Mr Haskell said: 'Mr Ibrahim and his friends then walked off almost celebrating what had just taken place.' He added: 'A witness called the police and Mr Ibrahim was arrested on August 21 last year.' Ibrahim also admitted to assault occasioning actual bodily harm, which occurred between March 20 and 24 last year, and a fight on April 10.
