It's said that everyone has a doppelganger, and some have stumbled upon their lookalikes in the strangest of places. People from across the globe have shared amusing photos of themselves posing alongside their doubles - be it in a 17th-century painting or on a crisp packet.   Among the other snaps, which have been compiled by Bored Panda, include one man who saw his own reflection in a doll in a supermarket store, and another who come across his mirror image in a museum. Elsewhere, a man thought he was seeing double when he looked up at an advertisement poster on a train - especially because the pair appeared to be wearing the same outfit.
