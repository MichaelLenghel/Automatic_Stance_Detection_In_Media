Aldi Australia is set to re-launch their popular French door fridge next week as part of their twice weekly special buys. The $999 fridge was first released last year and quickly sent shoppers into a frenzy  with many rushing to purchase the budget appliance. Similar models from the likes of Dick Smith and The Good Guys will set you back upwards of $3,000. Aldi's stylish fridge also comes complete with 'eco mode' to save electricity, 'super freezing mode' for fast freezing and a 'holiday mode' - which is perfect to use when you're going away. Other features include a touch panel, adjustable glass shelves and a temperature control pad. Australian cafe owner Mel Grob - who has been working in the hospitality industry for 15 years - offered a tour on how the fridge can do 'everything that it's supposed to do and more'. 'It's compact for a French door fridge yet roomy,' she said. 'It has loads of door storage, LED lighting, adjustable glass shelves, and a humidity and temperature control fresh zone to keep fruit and veg fresher for longer. 'It also has multi-flow air delivery for even cooling - and a frost-free freezer.' Those who have got wind of the fridge's release online have been quick to share their excitement about the launch. 'This is a game changer, I'm rushing down,' one person said.
