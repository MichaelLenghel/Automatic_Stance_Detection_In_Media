A Ryanair passenger has revealed their outrage after paying extra for a seat by a window on a flight - only to discover that his row didn't have one.  Marcos Molina, who lives in Germany, shared his annoyance online yesterday after flying from Berlin to Ireland.  He said he paid extra for a specific seat by a window in order to feel 'comfortable' for the 'cramped' flight, but when he arrived on the plane, he discovered that there wasn't a window on his row.  He demanded a refund from the airline, telling Dublin Live: 'It's super annoying because the whole point of paying extra is to get those little upgrades.'   Tweeting about his annoyance, he shared a snap of the seat before writing: 'The window seat I paid for, for my flight to Dublin. Refund? #travelfails.'  The Puerto Rican said he had had to pay extra for his return journey because he had been booked into the same seat going back. He said he had initially paid extra for the window seat in  order to feel 'more comfortable' on the 'cramped' flight. While some seats on a Ryanair flight are included in the price of the ticket, others, such as those with extra leg-room or closer to the front of the plane, do cost money.  For customers who want extra leg-room in the front row of the aircraft, the airline charges £20. However when booking online through the Ryanair website, it is impossible to tell which seats on the rows actually have windows next to them. The airline insisted that  customers are advised that there are no windows during the process. A spokesperson for Ryanair told Dublin Live: 'There are three seats on all Boeing Next Generation 737-800s that do not have windows.  'Customers who choose to purchase these seats are advised of this fact during the booking process on the website.'
