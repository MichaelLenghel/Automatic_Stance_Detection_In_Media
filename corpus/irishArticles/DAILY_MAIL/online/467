SHANGHAI, Feb 21 (Reuters) - The release of some Chinese foreign exchange data will be delayed because of the coronavirus outbreak, China's foreign exchange regulator said on Friday, adding that operations of the currency market were generally stable this month. The State Administration of Foreign Exchange said in an online statement that the release of data on trade in the currency market and commercial banks' foreign exchange sales for January would be postponed to March 6 due to the virus outbreak.
