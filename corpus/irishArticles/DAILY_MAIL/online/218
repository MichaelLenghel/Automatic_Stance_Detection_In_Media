As the latest Bond girl, she is often to be spied gracing the cover of fashion magazines. But when Ana de Armas was growing up, she had no trendy clothes, let alone designer wear. The 31-year-old Cuban-born actress has told how as a youngster she had to make do with garments made from her elder brother Javier Caso's hand-me-downs. Ms de Armas, who plays CIA agent Paloma in No Time To Die, said recycling clothes was an economic necessity in hard-up Havana. She told Net-a-Porter's online magazine Porter that she would wear shorts made from her brother's old school trousers. And she admitted that she still puts comfort before high fashion. She said: 'I get up so early to go to set. I see the cute boots or the sneakers – and I always choose the sneakers.' Ms de Armas said that although she is proud of her Cuban heritage she knew she needed to leave the communist-run country to pursue her acting career – she moved to Spain when she was 18. 'I knew the limitations of the country. I told my parents that was going to happen. 'They've been so supportive, I was lucky.  'But it was me going into the unknown,' she said. 'I put myself in their shoes and realise now what they were thinking, and how terrifying it must have been.' For No Time To Die, a set at Pinewood Studios was transformed into downtown Havana. Ms de Armas said that while it looked like home it didn't feel like it. 'It was completely freezing,' she admitted.
