Kmart has released a vacuum for kids which actually picks up dirt, turning their 'play house' games into useful housework. The Australian budget retailer has the vacuums for sale at $25 - a snap for parents who can now put their feet up while the kids do the floors. The battery-powered product, which is marketed at children three years old and above, is just like a real vacuum, with genuine suction and a realistic 'whirring' sound. 'If this actually works the person who did this deserves a pay rise! Shut up and take my money,' one mother said online.  But others wondered about the need for a toy vacuum. 'I just give them the real one. Get the job done properly,' one man said. Another user said: 'Dyson has one of these but five times the price with rainbow balls inside it... but I'd still give them the adult Dyson while you can convince them.'  While such 'play house' toys are marketed to girls, this product has a boy on the packaging. 'I love that there is finally a boy on the packaging of a product like this! Well played, Kmart,' one woman said. 'Kmart has a little boy on the box pushing one of the dolls prams also,' said another. A third added: 'I should show my husband... if only there was a box with a grown man on it'.   The vacuum is proving popular already with a number of people saying they have bought it for their toddlers' birthdays or as a non-chocolate Easter present. Many pointed out that it was best to 'teach them while they're small' so they don't become 'allergic' to the vacuum when they grow older. The cordless vacuum is available both in store and on the Kmart website.
