The last Monday in September is the peak day of the year for British couples to decide to divorce.  While it has long been believed most break-ups happen on the first Monday after Christmas or New Year's Day, a study cites the end of summer as the most common time for couples to call it quits, according to The Sunday Telegraph.   And the peak divorce dates correlate with the end of long school holidays which provide time for reflection, according to a family lawyer.    The Ministry of Justice's online divorce service logged 225 requests on Monday 30 September last year.  And this figure was double the daily average and substantially higher than an average Monday figure of 138.4.  It was also the highest daily number since the service was launched in April 2018. The study showed there was also a spike after the Christmas period, but it was not as pronounced as that on the last Monday of September. 'There have been suggestions there is this big day when people get divorced after Christmas because they have fallen out over the turkey,' Simon Blain, a partner specialising in family law at law firm Forsters, told the newspaper. 'Those who work in the industry have been trying to downplay that for years because we know that divorce tends not to be a decision that people make in haste. 'The correlation between the peak dates and divorce is generally at the end of the long school holidays, which often provide time for reflection and thought when you take time out of work and get the headspace to make big decisions in your life.' Overall Mondays were consistently the most popular day to apply for divorce according to Freedom of Information requests by the newspaper.  A total of 80,000 people have applied for divorce online since the system was launched.
