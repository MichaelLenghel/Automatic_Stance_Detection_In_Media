A second man has been charged with murder over the alleged fatal assault of another man in a western Sydney car park. Ross Houllis, 28, died in hospital last week after he was allegedly assaulted and dragged through the Bulls Road car park in Wakeley on February 14 by two men. He had attended the site to sell items he had advertised online, NSW Police said in a statement on Tuesday. Police say the two alleged assailants demanded cash, knocked Mr Houllis to the ground and seriously assaulted him before fleeing in a ute. Sami Hamdach, 27, was last week charged with murder and remains before the courts. Police on Tuesday searched a home at Yagoona in Sydney's southwest and arrested a 26-year-old man who was later charged with murder. The man was refused bail to appear at Bankstown Local Court later on Tuesday. Superintendent Brett McFadden described the alleged attack as "horrific". "The level of violence, it was cold, it was calculating, it was very deliberate," he said on Tuesday. "It's something that's just unacceptable for our society." Supt McFadden added that Mr Houllis' family is still coming to terms with their "tragic loss" and that investigations are ongoing.
