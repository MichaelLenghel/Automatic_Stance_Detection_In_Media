A TV reporter has slammed a stranger who yelled obscenities at her during a live cross about a murder verdict.  Channel 7 reporter Jessica Mumme was reporting that Tuhirangi-Thomas Tahiata had been found guilty of murdering two people outside of the Supreme Court in Brisbane at 4pm on Friday when a stranger made the crude comment.    Ms Mumme slammed the man for his rude behaviour in a tweet on Friday evening.  'Someone said f**k her up the p**** in the middle of my live cross this afternoon. Straight into my ear as I was talking about a murder verdict,' she wrote.  ’I'm not much of a whinger on here. But this is the exact kind of behaviour that needs to change.'   In a clip of the incident, Ms Mumme was reporting on the verdict before she was interrupted: 'During the trial Thahiata had admitted to using his car to the toolbox to the dam - ' The stranger can then be heard yelling out the vulgar phrase during the cross but is not pictured as overlay footage was being played.  Unphased by the interruption, Ms Mumme continued on: '- in January 2016. He also fired a shot to scare Cory and Iuliana as the toolbox was being submerged into the dam.'  The reporter's Twitter followers lauded her for seamlessly continuing the live cross without missing a beat.  'Into my actual ear - the one that didn’t have the ear piece in. Just a total grub,' Ms Mumme wrote, replying to one comment.  One person pointed out that it was a long running stunt during live crosses, to which Ms Mumme replied: 'It’s also so old!'      The phrase 'f**k her right in the p***y' is known as the FHRITP prank and first gained popularity in 2014 after a series of viral videos circulated online.  US filmmaker John Cain uploaded a video that showed a FOX news reporter making crude remarks about a missing woman, including the infamous phrase, in January 2014. As of publishing, the video has over 4million views on YouTube.  A month later, Mr Cain uploaded another video in which a Cincinnati news reporter is interrupted by a moustached man in a black hoodie and sunglasses.  In the clip, the man grabs the microphone, yells FHRITP and runs away - becoming a viral hit with over 7million views as of publishing.   The hoodied man featured in two more similar clips harassing female reporters while a compilation of all four clips has 8 million views.   In May 2015, Mr Cain revealed that all of the clips were faked as the mustached man and the reporters were actors. The filmmaker even acted as the FOX news reporter in the original clip from 2014.  Since these videos circulated online, men continue to shout the phrase during live crosses for TV news, with female reporters often targeted.  Canadian reporter Shauna Hunt even confronted soccer fans when they yelled FHRITP during a live cross but the men in May 2015.
