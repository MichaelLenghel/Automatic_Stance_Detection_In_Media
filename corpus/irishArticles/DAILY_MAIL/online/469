She's the jaw-dropping Australian actress and model who rarely puts a foot out of line when it comes to red carpet fashion. But Nicky Whelan opted for a very unusual choice of outfit on Friday, as she rocked up to REGARD Magazine's 10 Year Anniversary in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles. The 38-year-old decided on a torso-flashing knitted cropped top for the occasion, which she teamed with a pair of smart black trousers with a ruched waist. While the outfit looked sensational on her phenomenal frame, Nicky decided to go '90s chic up top - bizarrely donning wildly crimped hair and bright blue earrings. She teamed her look with a pair of black boot stilettos, and accessorised with huge rings on her fingers. She wore a coral pink lip colour on her lips, and emphasised her striking eyes with just a hint of black mascara and eyeliner. Nicky has never been shy when it comes to showing off her figure, and regularly posts snaps of herself in bikinis online. She previously revealed her diet and exercise regime to Muscle and Fitness while training for the action series, Matador. 'As for diet, I eat small meals all day,' she said. 'I start every day with a green shake in my blender, then follow that with coffee.' The Left Behind star explained she 'changes up her training' but likes to keep a 'healthy, happy mind.' The Wedding Ringer actress hails from Shepparton, but is now based in the US where she has had a successful film career.
