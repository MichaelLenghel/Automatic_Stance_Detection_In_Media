A remote outback teacher from Western Australia has been charged after allegedly pestering a child to engage in sexual behaviour over social media.  The man, from the remote Goldfields-Esperance district of Western Australia, has been accused of using social media to engage in online sexual behaviour with a girl who he met while he was a teacher.  The teenager, aged under 16, was not his student at the time of the alleged offending which occurred between December last year and January, WA Police said on Friday. Kalgoorlie detectives searched the man's house on Tuesday and allegedly found child abuse material on some of his electronic devices, police said. Police said they are still analysing the devices. The man has been charged with three counts of encouraging a child over 13 and under 16 to engage in sexual behaviour, three counts of indecently dealing with a child, one count of persistent sexual conduct with a child, and one count of possessing child exploitation material. The teacher is due to appear at Kalgoorlie Magistrates Court on March 23. The investigation is ongoing and police urge anyone with information to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or make a report online at www.crimestopperswa.com.au
