A Melbourne mother who claims she's been ripped off by Coles has warned other shoppers who use supermarket self-service checkouts to check their receipts. The woman expressed her outrage online after she was overcharged for a bottle of Fabulon Ironing Aid at Coles in the bayside suburb of St Kilda on Saturday.  Charged $6.50 at the checkout, she returned to the aisle after paying for the items to double check the product price on the shelf and found it was $1.71 cheaper. The shopper said she'd been more vigilant about checking her receipts following a recent warning she'd read about over-charging for petrol. She said Saturday's trip to the supermarket was the third time in two weeks she'd been overcharged in Coles.  'That's 100 per of the time I have been overcharged for an item,' the woman posted.  'It took me 15 minutes and me walking back to check the actual price as the operator insisted it was scanning correctly. Then the manager argued with me.'  'Okay, first world problem here but I'm wondering if this systematic and deliberate.' While the price tag on the store shelf clearly states $4.79, the product retails online for $6.50 at both Coles and Woolworths.   Daily Mail Australia has contacted the woman and Coles for further comment.
