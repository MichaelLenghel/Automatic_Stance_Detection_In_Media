Outdoor advertiser oOh!media says unprecedented media market softness, federal election fallout and a weak economy have contributed to a mixed full-year performance in which revenue edged higher but profit took a hit. Chief executive Brendon Cook said his company had bounced back from a difficult second and third quarter to deliver revenue growth in line with the out-of-home ad market and had achieved its revised underlying earnings target. Mr Cook, who last month announced he was leaving the business, confirmed the company had taken an expected hit from advertising softness around the federal election in May as well as general industry decline. Excluding leasing impacts and factoring in the underlying FY18 result of Adshel before its acquisition, oOh!media's revenue edged 1.0 per cent higher to $649.6 million. Underlying earnings in the year to December 31 fell 5.0 per cent to $139 million, reflecting a tough media environment but in line with the company's revised outlook. The company, which also owns online masthead Junkee, had said in January it was on track to meet underlying earnings guidance at the lower end of its $138 million to $143 million range, which had been raised in December. The firm booked $13.7 million in non-operating items for 2019, most related to the Commute acquisition, as well as a $3.5 million impairment charge against its investment in Junkee on "revised revenue" expectations. Net profit after tax for the year fell 32 per cent to $27.2 million. Shares in oOh!media fell 1.71 per cent to $2.88 after 45 minutes of trade on Monday. The company said it had been buoyed by revenue at Commute rising 5.0 per cent for the year to $234.8 million as the segment's integration continues apace. The rail assets in particular benefited from the Melbourne-Sydney package offering subsequent to the Metro Trains Melbourne contract win - effective April 2018 - which generated the strong first-half growth. The company said Commute's revenues declined in the second half but at a slightly lower rate than the broader out-of-home industry. "Commute is now our largest division by revenue and its strong performance ... demonstrates its significant contribution to enhancing our diversified asset portfolio and supporting our acquisition business case," Mr Cook said. Retail segment revenue rose 5.0 per cent to $139.1 million. However, road advertising fell 5.0 per cent to $146.6 million during the year thanks to a reduction in spending by the banks and auto industry. Fly revenue dropped 3.0 per cent to $65.9 million, affected by the reversion of the Sydney Airport Qantas Terminal to the Airport, over which a competitor had the rights effective from July 1 2019, and the soft billboard market. On a statutory basis, total revenue increased 35 per cent. Digital revenue as a percentage of the company's total revenue was 61 per cent for the year, compared with 60 per cent in 2018. Meanwhile, statutory net profit dropped 54 per cent to $13.45 million, from $29.12 million a year ago The company will maintain a fully franked final dividend of 7.5 cents per share. Mr Cook, who founded oOh!media 30 years ago, said the search continued for his replacement. MIXED YEAR FOR OOH!MEDIA * Pro-forma revenue up 1.0pct to $649.6m * Pro-forma net profit down 32pct to $27.2m * Statutory revenue up 35pct to $649.6m * Statutory profit down 54pct to $13.45m * Final fully franked dividend 7.5 cents, unchanged.
