A mother has been filmed letting her teenage son slap her breasts to the tune of a song as part of a bizarre Tik Tok challenge. Aiden Ridings, 17, filmed the bizarre video and uploaded it to social media last week in a strange attempt to gain more followers. The eight-second video starts with the two standing opposite each other as the 2008 hit Undercover Martyn by Two Door Cinema Club plays. The teenager dances to the tune before hitting one breast after the other in quick succession in time with the beat. They both laugh together as the video ends. While the Western Australian diesel mechanic later deleted the footage, it was re-posted on Twitter and has been viewed more than four-million times. Social media users were shocked. 'NOTHING makes me more uncomfortable than this,' one Twitter user said. 'What in the fresh hell?' another asked. 'Their comfort is too much for my brain,' someone else commented. But others picked up on the finer details. 'The worst part is that this didn't seem out of pocket to her... her face really said "Oh Aiden you goofball not again!",' one person shared. 'Why she looking into his eyes like that?' another asked. But Aiden choose to ignore the criticism. He said both he and his mother were happy with the video and found it amusing.  'I thought it was really funny and I needed to do the video for laughs on my TikTok page,' he said.  'The reaction I got online was OK, some people were laughing and some people weren't but that's social media.'
