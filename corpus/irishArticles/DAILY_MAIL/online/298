Rodecaster Pro £599, rode.com Like many middle-aged men, I have occasional thoughts that my piercing insights into technology or life in general should be released as a wildly popular podcast. But then I remember the well-worn online joke: ‘What do you call a group of three or more straight white men? A podcast,’ and I realise my insights might not be quite as unique as I imagine. But if you are thinking of subjecting the world to half an hour of your opinions on, say, Mongolian throat singing, the Rodecaster Pro does a fairly passable impression of an actual radio studio, complete with faders which you can push up while mouthing jargon like ‘Mic up in five seconds’ to your bemused co-hosts. It’s got four XLR microphone inputs (although you’ll need to supply your own mics), and pads for playing jingles and sound effects. It all looks a little Fisher Price, but feels exhilaratingly professional. The results aren’t quite what you’d get using pro audio gear – but most pro audio gear seems designed to baffle and terrify the uninformed. The Rodecaster is a cinch to use. Where the Rodecaster excels is that it’s portable, recording to a built-in memory card (you can access the audio from your PC via the gizmo, or just via a card reader). Most podcasters, of course, probably don’t need something this highly specced: you can do perfectly well with a couple of USB mics plugged into a PC. Especially if you’re doing something destined to be really unpopular (which, let’s face it, most podcasts are).
