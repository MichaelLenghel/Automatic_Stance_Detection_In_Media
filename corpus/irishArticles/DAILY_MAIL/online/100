An inconsiderate Ferarri driver has been slammed for parking their $150,000 supercar in a disabled spot.   The red Ferrari 360 Spider was pictured in a Brisbane car park with no sign of a disabled permit.   The offending sports car was uploaded to a Brisbane Reddit thread on Monday with the caption: 'W****r.' The image showed how the luxury Ferrari was parked next to a branch of the chain store Cafe 63.  The person who outed the Ferrari said they 'looked for a disabled permit' but there was 'none spotted'.    'I bet their legs could easily have walked a few extra steps. Not so easy for some folks, they need that spot,' one furious person said. 'I’d have a hard time not keying the guy’s car after that,' another said.   'Public shaming time, walk in and yell out "Can the person with the red sports car please move from the disability parking spot?",' suggested a third.  Drivers who park illegally in disabled spots can be fined up to $659 and lose demerit points. The Ferrari sighting comes just weeks after an Audi driver was slammed for parking  her luxury car across two disabled spots.  The driver had parked her $79,500 black Audi A5 Quattro in front of a Coles Express in Melbourne.  An outraged commenter wrote: 'Way to live up to the Audi d******bag stereotype.'   A Sydney driver was also fined $572 for parking across two disabled spots in early February.  The white HiLux and trailer was stopped in a car park at Bayview Park in Sydney's northern beaches.   A follow-up picture showed the motorist received a fine for parking 'vehicle in designated disability parking space'.  One viewer said the motorist should have received two fines for taking up two disability spots.
