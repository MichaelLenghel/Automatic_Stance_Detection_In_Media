Australia's intelligence and security agencies would be more closely monitored under proposed laws put forward by Labor. Opposition frontbencher Jenny McAllister is introducing legislation to enhance oversight of the increasingly powerful agencies, as recommended by a coalition government review three years ago. "Unfortunately, like its approach on so many matters of accountability, the Morrison government has dragged the chain on implementing important recommendations from its own review," she said on Monday. "Strong and effective oversight mechanisms do not stand in opposition to our national security arrangements - they are best understood as an essential part of them." Senator McAllister wants parliament's powerful national security committee to work more closely with two federal government watchdogs. Her bill would also give the committee and watchdogs oversight of the intelligence activities at the Department of Home Affairs. "Strong and effective oversight measures do not represent a lack of trust in the intelligence community," Senator McAllister said. "They represent an investment in the trust they need to successfully perform their roles and protect the community within a democracy." The legislation being introduced on Monday comes as the government investigates ways to give security agencies more powers to disrupt the online activities of Australian paedophiles.
