He was out searching for a place to have a picnic, but the only thing this one-year-old had eyes for was the stale bread his family were feeding ducks.  Rowdy Ryan, who turned one this week, was visiting Centennial Park, in Sydney's east, with his parents and sister Stella Ryan, 3, on Saturday to scope out places to have his first birthday party this weekend. But planning the toddler's Peter Rabbit picnic was trumped by Rowdy's excitement to swing past the park's Kensington Ponds to see the ducks- and eat their food.   In a hilarious video posted online, the boy's mother hands her daughter some bread, which she throws into the water. 'Here you go,' Stella, 3, calls out to the birds. The mother then turns to her son for his turn. 'Rowdy, you want to feed the ducks?' she asks, passing him a piece of bread. But the young boy grabs the bread and shoves it into his mouth. 'Rowdy, you're meant to feed the duckies,' his mother says.  Rowdy's mother told Daily Mail Australia her son has a love for food.  'We had just eaten lunch and as usual the little guy had eaten about twice as much as his sister,' she said.  'It wasn't even fresh bread. It was stale old crusts that I'd saved for the ducks. 'This kid will seriously eat anything.' The mother-of-two said seeing the feathered creatures was high on Rowdy's list of priorities during the weekend outing. 'He was so excited about seeing the ducks,' she said. 'He has never fed them before but I thought he would just copy his sister like he usually does. 'So many people have commented that I must have forgotten to feed him that day. But he just doesn't like sharing food.'
