A Melbourne woman has been charged with allegedly recruiting and associating with terrorists from Islamic State. The 22-year-old was charged after a joint operation by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, Australian Federal Police and Victoria Police at a home in Hallam. Police say the woman allegedly helped and encouraged a person to travel to Syria and Iraq in 2016 to fight with the terror group. She also allegedly connected online with an IS fighter in Syria in 2015. She has been charged with performing services for a person who is intending to enter a foreign country and engage in hostile activity, recruiting a person to participate in the activities of a terrorist organisation, and associating with a terrorist organisation. The charges have maximum penalties of life in prison. The accused is expected to face Melbourne Magistrates' Court on Tuesday.
