A woman's hack to find the perfect pair of shoes for every outfit by using a tiny cutout version of herself when shopping online has been hailed a 'game changer' by shoppers. Megan Papas, who works for New Zealand radio station ZM, shared a clip of her tip to Facebook, which has since been inundated with 15,000 likes and 48,000 comments. She explained that to ensure accessories match an ensemble, she prints out a picture of herself wearing the outfit and places it above the shoes when searching online.  The Auckland-based demonstrated the trick by printing out a picture of her side profile, and then snipping off her feet and laminating it. She was then able to position the printout above images of shoes online to see whether or not they would go with an outfit. The hack means Megan can mostly avoid returning items bought online because she knows exactly what the will look like on her beforehand.  The video was captioned: 'Megan’s online shoe shopping trick is too good.'  Impressed social media users were quick to share their enthusiasm for the tip, with one writing: 'Game changer!' Another said: 'I’m going to start doing this,' as a third added: 'Why am I laughing so much! That's brilliant!' It comes after a woman shared her 'natural' trick for a beautiful-smelling car, which she claimed will banish all bad scents and make it smell fresh.
