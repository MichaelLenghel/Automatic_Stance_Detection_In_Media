A crafty woman was praised online for creating a 'beautiful' vase out of a spare KFC bucket - with fans admitting they couldn't wait to make their own.  Elaina Sanches, 48, from Maesteg, Wales, shared photographs of her thrifty design - which saw the tub painted white and adorned with paper cut-outs and lace trim - to the Facebook group DIY On A Budget UK this weekend. Her post was quickly inundated with hundreds of likes and many comments complimenting Elaina for her crafting skills. Sharing snaps of her work, she explained that she'd ended up with three buckets with her KFC order and two were clean.  She explained: 'Just thought, "I’m going to craft it". I’m a crafter ladies, I craft everything. It's my own idea, this one.'  Having realised she had two clean, spare buckets to use, Elaina, who has her own Facebook page dedicated to her crafty designs, soon set about making them into fashionable containers. She covered the exterior with white paint and glued on paper floral cut-outs, before adding a crochet lace trim on the edges.   Elaina completed her flower pot with pink bows and captured how it could be filled with faux flowers - or even chocolate treats to make it the perfect gift.  Members of the group were impressed and shared their enthusiasm for the designs, with one person writing: 'Love that, next time I get KFC I might craft the box.' Another said: 'You would never know. Looks good,' before joking: 'The sales of KFC are going up now.' 'This is absolutely beautiful and very creative,' a third said. 'You could eat KFC every night and next morning craft buckets and sell.'
