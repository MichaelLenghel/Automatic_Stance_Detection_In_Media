She had waited all year for this one moment and when the time came, this little girl didn't want to wait a second longer when it came to getting stuck into her birthday cake.  Sitting in a high-chair, the unidentified toddler from Buffalo, New York, dove face first into the yellow and white frosting. In an hilarious video posted online, the little girl doesn't even come up for air for several seconds as she savors the moment and feasts on the sugary icing as part of her birthday cake smash.  Then, as if acting perfectly normal, the youngster looks up to see the other guests at her party, with her face completely covered in vanilla frosting.  She looks around to make sure everyone else is still enjoying themselves as she blinks while giving off a look of complete innocence.   After a few moments, she dives back into the cake for a second helping. At one point, the girl appears to be so deep into the sponge cake that her cute headband, decorated with pink and white flowers, appears to be virtually indistinguishable from the decorative ones set around the base of the cake.
