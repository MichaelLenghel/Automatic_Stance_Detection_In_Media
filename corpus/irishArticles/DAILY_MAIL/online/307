Popular TikTok stars earn as much as $200,000 per 60-second post, and could charge major brands as much as $1million next year, experts forecast.  Influencers have much to gain financially by collaborating with multinational companies and promote their brands to millions of TikTok followers.  Research conducted by Online Casino indicates that popular TikTok stars could be paid up to $0.005 per follower for sponsored posts.  Astonishingly, these posts last a mere 15 to 60 seconds, making the influencers some of the biggest and quickest earners on the planet. This means that a star like 17-year-old singer Loren Gray, from Pennsylvania, who has over 38million followers, can charge nearly $200,000 per post.  BabyAriel, with an estimated 30million followers, could earn around $150,000 per post, while LA-based Pomeranian dog Jiffpom would rake in $100,000 per post. She is known to have collaborated with EA Games on its Sims 4: Get Famous.    As current projections stand, TikTok sensation Aashika Bhatia, a 19-year-old Bollywood actress, is well on her way to gaining a whopping 194million followers. Buddying up with the right company could see her charge $973,000 a post.    Meanwhile, fashion blogger Savannah LaBrant, with nearly 139million followers, could be earning an unbelievable $693,000 per post.  James Whatley, strategy partner at marketing agency Digitas UK, told The Guardian that 'TikTok is the darling of 2020'. He explained: 'The fastest way to get traction on TikTok is to get the number-one influencer to promote your stuff.  'Just this week TikTok and Fortnite announced a partnership deal with a competition for a TikTok dance to be recreated on Fortnite. 'Every year there is always a new platform and clients want to put 10% of their budget towards it. Last year it was Instagram stories, before that Snapchat. 'TikTok is the darling of 2020.'  The Chinese app, valued at $75billion in 2018, last week introduced new features giving parents control over the content they see in their child's feed.  Family Safety Mode now helps parents and guardians keep their teens safe on the platform by linking a parent's account to their child's account.  Parents can use the system to control how long children spend on TikTok each day, limit or turn off direct messaging and rebuff inappropriate content.  MailOnline has approached TikTok for comment.  TikTok is a Chinese social media app where users can live stream, create short videos and music videos and Gifs with a host of functions.   It was the most downloaded app in the US in 2018 and the world's fourth most downloaded app in 2018, ahead of Instagram and Snapchat. TikTok is known in China as Douyin where it was launched in 2016 and then made more widely available around the world in 2017.   Douyin is still the version of the app used in China, available to download separately to TikTok. The app was merged with popular music video lip-syncing app Musical.ly, also with headquarters in China.  Most children use the app to film themselves lip-syncing to chart hits. It offers users a raft of colourful modification and editing tools including overlaying music, sound, stickers, filters and augmented reality for creating videos.  The Beijing based social network has more than 500 million active users and the company is now worth more than $75 billion (£58 billion).
