A London-based pie shop is sending pastry lovers wild after launching a 'Full English Tart' which sees a fry-up breakfast served in a puff base. St. Paul's bakery Epic Pies has combined the two classic treats in a mash-up for its new breakfast menu.  The huge breakfast, which costs just £7.95, includes two sausages, two slices of bacon, sauteed mushrooms, beans, cherry tomatoes and a fried egg.  Customers have been going wild over the breakfast dish on social media, with one commenting: 'That full English tart is something else!' Diners can also add extras to the tasty dish, including a hash brown and a slice of black pudding, for just £1.  Those diners who are feeling less adventurous in the morning can swap the pie crust for slices of toast.        The pie shop, which is located close to St. Paul's Cathedral, opens at 8am throughout the week for hungry commuters looking for a full breakfast.  Social media users said they couldn't wait to try the tasty treat, with one commenting: 'That will last me all day.'   Another wrote: 'And it's delish!'  One added: 'The Best Breakfast in the City Of London!'  Another person tagged a friend, commenting: 'You need to visit here!'  The trendy cafe, which opened in 2015, calls itself 'a very British patisserie'.  It's run by mother and son duo Daniel and Roshnara Jobz who opened the shop after spending four years building up a fanbase of pastry fans at festivals across the city.   The pie shop also serves up pastry delights including the 'Eastender', a pie with a slowly braised peppered steak with peas and carrots, and a Veggie delight, which combines butternut squash, chestnut mushroom, spinach and leeks in a lightly spiced cream sauce.
