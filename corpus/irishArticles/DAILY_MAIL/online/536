Marvel has faced criticism from Scottish independence supporters after unveiling a British superhero group called The Union. The franchise, which created Spider-Man and the Avengers, said The Union would consist of five characters representing different parts of the UK. The group will fight alongside the Avengers and Fantastic Four to stop an alien invasion in a new five-part series called Empyre. The team includes existing Marvel character Union Jack – an Englishman who has served with MI5 – and dark and forbidding Snakes, who represents Northern Ireland.  The Choir represents Wales and Kelpie is a pink-haired Scot. They are led by a fifth character called Britannia. The announcement faced criticism online with many branding the comic 'badly misjudged' due to support for a second referendum on Scottish independence. One person wrote: 'I think it's tone deaf to create a team like this whilst so many other parts of the country are fighting hard for independence.' The comic book's writer, Paul Grist, who has also written adventures for Judge Dredd, defended the project after one Twitter user posted: 'Read a room man, no one, especially not in Scotland, is looking for pro-Union Tory superheroes.' Mr Grist responded: 'That's not really the comic I'm writing.' Others defended him, with one tweeting: 'Comics are supposed to be fun and aspire to be the best their country has to offer.' The Union, featuring art by Andrea Di Vito, goes on sale in May.
