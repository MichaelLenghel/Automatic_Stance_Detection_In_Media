Brendan Fevola has revealed that he's finally deleted the Uber Eats app, after splashing out more than $35,000 on the food delivery service.    Speaking on his show Fifi, Fev & Byron, the former AFL star said that his partner Alex is now in control over what he orders online.   The 39-year-old former Carlton player was apparently in the 0.02 per cent of Uber Eats users in Australia.  'It is on Alex's phone. If it is a weekend and it is a Saturday night we can still order it but I will not be ordering,' Brendan said.  Brendan revealed that he ordered Uber Eats up to four times a day.  'We get home at a certain time and I get hungry and you just eat and you eat,' Brendan said.   'I was ordering Uber Eats, this is no word of a lie, a minimum of twice a day, sometimes up to four times because you order it to work.' 'When you get home, then you have another snack, and then you might order dessert, then you order dinner.'   Describing himself as 'old school', Brendan now drives to the takeaway store in he feels like ordering in.  Brendan is focusing on his health and fitness with the aim on joining a suburban football league in 2020.    Last year, he discovered he had spent $35,000 on the food app. In March, the shocking five-figure total was revealed by his co-host Byron on their radio show Fifi, Fev & Byron.  According to Byron, in the 18 months Fevola had the app, he had made 588 orders from 108 different restaurants, which places him in the top 0.02 per cent of Uber Eats users in Australia. 'That's a lot of money, I'm in trouble,' Brendan said at the time. 'I just got a message [from] my ex-wife, now fiancée. She just wrote, 'I'm divorcing you again!'
