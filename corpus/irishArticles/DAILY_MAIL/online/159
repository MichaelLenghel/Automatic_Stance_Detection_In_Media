Britain's favourite emoji has been revealed following a nationwide survey.  'Face With Tears of Joy' tops the list of the 25 most popular emojis, according to the study of 2,000 British adults.  'Thumbs Up', 'Smiling Face with Smiling Eyes' and 'Face Blowing A Kiss' take the second, third and fourth places, respectively, with 'Hearts For Eyes' rounding out the top five.  The survey, commissioned by TUTANKHAMUN: Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh exhibition, explored how people are using emojis to replace language, with 91 per cent of respondents saying they use the icons in everyday communication.  Unsurprisingly, the data found that 43 per cent of people aged 16 to 29 use emojis every day compared to just 9 per cent of people over 60s.   Here, a closer look at the 25 most popular emojis and their meanings, according to emojipedia.org. Tutankhamun: Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh presented by Viking Cruises runs at the Saatchi Gallery until 3 May, 2020. Tickets are on-sale now via www.tutankhamun-london.com.  1.
