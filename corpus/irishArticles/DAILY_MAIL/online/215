Whitney Port was all smiles while enjoying a nice day at the farmers market with 2-year-old son Sonny and husband Tim Rosenman on Sunday.  The 34-year-old star, who chatted with a red-headed pal before meeting back up with her family at the play area, beamed while sampling iced drinks and enjoying a cup of coffee.  For her fun outing, Port kept her look casual in a warm olive jacket over a grey hoodie, coordinating leggings and a pair of black Converse sneakers.  The reality TV star kept her blonde tresses slicked back in a messy ponytail, while showing off her fresh face under a pair of honey-colored frames and carrying a variety of snacks.  Flanking her side, Rosenman held onto a black stroller with their son strapped inside, while wearing a hot pink shirt and light-wash jeans.  The couple's only child wore a light blue sweatsuit and had fun at a climbing wall nearby.  The Hills alum recently made headlines for defending her son against hateful comments directed at his hair online. Port slammed 'homophobic' messages' in a recent YouTube video that addresses an uptick of nasty comment. 'How you dress is an expression of you and your personality and no one should tell you there is one way to do it,' Whitney said, revealing her zero tolerance for online bullies. 'If he wants to wear a dress, he can wear a f***ing dress,' remarked Rosenman who prompted Port from behind the camera, as she took center stage for the six minute and 30-second video. Tim emphasized that the couple are 'not pushing' their son 'towards heterosexuality or homosexuality.' 'He will just be whoever he is born to be and we're here to support that...not push him in one direction or another,' concluded Rosenman as his wife nodded in approval.
