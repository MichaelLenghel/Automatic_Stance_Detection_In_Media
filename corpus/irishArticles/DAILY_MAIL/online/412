A clever canine was caught on camera keeping himself entertained after learning how to throw his own ball.   The footage was recorded at the family home in Hollywood, Florida, on Wednesday.  The dog, which appears to be a Yorkshire Terrier, repeatedly drops his tennis ball down the stairs before enthusiastically chasing after it.    In the video, the adorable pooch, called Parker, can be seen sitting patiently at the top of the stairs. The fluorescent-colored ball steadily bounces on each step on its way down to the ground before he sets off chasing after it. He quickly swoops in and grips it tightly in his jaws. Parker then races back up to the top of the stairs before repeating the process over and over again. The video ends shortly afterwards.       The cameraman later uploaded the footage online and said: 'This is my parents' dog, Parker.  'We were just finishing lunch when he started throwing the ball to fetch himself.  'We play with him as much as we can but that's not enough for him.  'He learned to throw the ball down the stairs all by himself, he's a smart pupper.'
