She announced her third pregnancy just weeks ago. And Ciara looked positively beaming as she flaunted her growing baby bump for a bikini snap shared to Instagram on Friday morning. The 34-year-old singer wore a tiny two-piece to pose for her legions of fans online as she enjoyed a tropical babymoon with husband Russell Wilson. Ciara was glowing as she stood in the sunshine to reveal her ever-changing figure for a poolside snap. She let the wind catch her lacy duster which matched a crisp white triangle top and cheeky bottoms. The Goodies hitmaker protected her face from the harsh elements with a linen bucket cap and wore circular frames over her eyes.  Her long brown hair was worn in layers of braids and she appeared to be relatively makeup-free.  She wrapped her arms around her husband for a sweet black-and-white snap with the caption '#Friday Flicks.'  The Texas native — who's real name is Ciara Princess Harris — showed off an impressive dessert on her Instagram story with 'Happy Babymoon' scrawled onto a piece of chocolate.  Russell and Ciara announced their baby joy just weeks ago with a vacation snap shared on social media, simply captioned 'Number 3.'  The happy couple married in 2016 and welcomed daughter Sienna Princess Wilson one year later. Ciara was already a mother by the time she started dating Russell, who acts as stepfather to her five-year-old son Future with her ex, rapper Future.
