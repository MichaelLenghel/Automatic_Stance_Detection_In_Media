Myer has caused a stir after releasing a controversial range of tea towels featuring animals appearing to be having sex. The tea towel is part of the La La Land Wild Fur You Australian range sold at Myer stores across and country and online. The tea towel, which retails for $19.95, features animals such as wombats, emus and kangaroos appearing to fornicate. The design also features on mugs, tote bags and coin purses.  'Washing up your dishes just got a whole lot more steamy,' the product description reads.  An image of the tea towel was shared to Facebook, with one person asking if anyone else had seen the product in stores.  Some social media users said the cheeky design was great to see after billions of animals were wiped out during the horror bushfire season.  'I don't know if i should laugh, cry or be shocked,' one person said.  Another said it would make a perfect gift for people overseas.  The print was sold on bags as early as 2018, which sparked similar reactions. 'Well I'll be... it's a f***ing bag,' one person said at the time. 'Using mine today! You're welcome everyone getting a giggle outta it,' another said. The print was designed by Lilly Perrott.  Daily Mail Australia has contacted Myer for comment.
