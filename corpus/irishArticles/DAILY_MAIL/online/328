She welcomed her first child, a daughter named Frankie Violet, in October. And on Saturday, Jennifer Hawkins doted on her newborn as they shared a sweet mother-daughter moment together.  In the video she shared to Instagram, the 36-year-old is seen sitting with her baby daughter on her lap, who is clasping tightly onto her fingers. 'I just luvvv ya Frankie girl,' the supermodel captioned the post. Fans were quick to comment on the sweet moment, telling Jennifer that babies grow up too fast. 'They grow too quickly then just like that they are a toddler or starting school etc. enjoy good and bad moments,' wrote one woman. 'Oh I miss those newborn feels,' commented another.   The sweet moment comes after Jennifer was trolled on Instagram last month over a perfectly innocent photo of her at the beach with her daughter. Keyboard warriors unfairly suggested that she wasn't being sun safe with Frankie, who wasn't wearing a hat in the sunny weather. 'Where's the baby's hat?' asked one of Jennifer's followers, while another wrote: 'Loving the photo but why does Mummy have a hat on and not Bubba?'  The former Myer ambassador was quick to respond to her critics at the time. She clarified that 'bub was under a beach umbrella two seconds after [the] picture' was taken. Announcing the baby's arrival on Instagram, the businesswoman wrote that her daughter was 'a dream come true'. 'Frankie Violet Hawkins Wall,' she began. 'Dream come true! So thankful to be holding our beautiful healthy baby girl! We couldn't be more in love.'
