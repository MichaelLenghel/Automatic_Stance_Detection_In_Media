She's the teenage phenomenon who keeps breaking records. Now American Billie Eilish, 18, has become the first female artist to score a UK number one with a James Bond theme song. The singer-songwriter topped the Official Singles Chart yesterday with No Time To Die, which features in the upcoming 007 film of the same name. British singer Sam Smith, 27, is the only other artist to bag a UK number one with a Bond theme, having taken the top spot with Writing's On The Wall from Spectre in 2015. Miss Eilish's song made 90,000 chart sales across the past week and racked up 10.6million online streams.  She outsold Smith's Bond track, which notched up nearly 70,000 chart sales, and Adele's Skyfall, which shifted 84,000 copies in 2012.  She performed No Time To Die live for the first time at the Brit Awards on Tuesday, where she won Best International Female. Miss Eilish recently revealed she had to get the thumbs-up from 007 star Daniel Craig before releasing the track.  She told BBC Breakfast: 'He has a big say in it. We learned that from this. He's really involved.  'We haven't met him but he's got to like it before they move on.'  Her brother Finneas O'Connell, 22, who co-wrote the song, added: 'If Daniel doesn't like it, then you don't get the job.'   Official Charts chief executive Martin Talbot said: 'What a fantastic achievement this is for Billie Eilish, to set new standards for a brand new Bond track and break through through the one billion barrier for audio streams in the UK. 'Both achievements coming in the week when she was one of the standout performers and victors at the 40th Brit Awards. 'She is a superstar who is clearly "Licensed To Win".'
