A pit bull puppy has been left outside a Mexican rescue shelter along with a heartbreaking letter penned by the animal's 12-year-old owner.  The canine was dropped off at Refugio Xollin in the state of Michoacan on February 13, with the young owner's note explaining in Spanish why the canine could no longer be kept in their care.  'My name is Andrés and I am 12 years old,' the letter reads in English. 'My mom and I decided to leave my dog in your hands, hiding it from my dad because he is thinking about selling him. But he mistreats and kicks him.  The letter continued: 'One day he kicked him so hard that he hurt his tail. I hope you can help and take care of him. I left him a stuffed animal so he won't forget me.' The shelter shared the sad note to Facebook, along with adorable photos of the pit bull pup, which quickly went viral.  More than 300 people requested to adopt the adorable animal - who has been named Rene - in the days after the post was put up.  The requests have come from all over the country, according to CNN.  It appears the shelter has not yet decided on an owner for Rene, who is still in their care.  The pup has been dewormed and seen by a vet, and is ready for adoption.   But while only one lucky family will get to welcome Rene into their home, the shelter is reminding people they 120 other pups who need to be adopted out.  'If everyone opened their heart and their home like this little dog, they would have adopted all our dogs from the shelter,' the shelter posted on Facebook.
