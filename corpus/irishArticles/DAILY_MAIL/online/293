A would-be suitor has left the internet in stitches after replying to a woman's text eight years after receiving it - blaming his phone's automatic updates for the lapse in time.  The conversation was shared on a popular Australian Instagram page, poking fun at the difficulties of online dating in the modern age. 'Can we please spare a thought for Sally who this morning received a reply from an Adelaide guy who had to wait a mere eight years and seven months for his phone to update,' the post read.  The conversation began on July 17, 2011, when the technologically challenged man asked Sally how she was doing, adding a suggestive emoji to his query. Sally replied three days later on July 20 by saying she was 'good thanks' and similarly asking what he had been up to.   The chat mysteriously went quiet with no reply until more than 3,130 days later when the Aussie man responded to say he had only just received her message from 2011. 'I had an update on my phone... long time it has been,' he said.   The social media post ridiculing the hilarious exchange has since received more than 10,000 likes and hundreds of comments. 'That's a standard reply time,' one woman said. 'He is a man of focus and sheer commitment,' a man said.  It is not known if Sally replied to the man's extremely delayed message.
