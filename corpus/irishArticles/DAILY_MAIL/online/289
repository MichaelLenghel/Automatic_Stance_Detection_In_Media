After actor Laurence Fox clashed with a BBC1 Question Time audience member and denied that the Duchess of Sussex had been a victim of racism, he received vile death threats. Now we can reveal that the rest of his famous showbusiness family have come under fire from ‘woke warriors’ following his controversial appearance on the BBC show last month. His cousin Freddie was spat at in the street around the time of the incident, while Freddie’s sister, Silent Witness actress Emilia, has received hateful abuse by online trolls who believe that the pair share Laurence’s views. A source tells us: ‘Emilia and Freddie are quite sensitive and rarely air their views in public. Now they have been dragged into this argument and they don’t know how to deal with it.’ The abuse has cast a shadow on Freddie’s success in the critically acclaimed ITV drama White House Farm, in which he played killer Jeremy Bamber. ‘Freddie should be basking in the glory – instead, he’s wiping spit off his face,’ the source says. ‘Emilia is taking things in her stride, but it is frightening how an opinion can cause so much misery to Laurence’s family.’ The disgusting attacks come after Laurence’s Question Time appearance, in which he was dubbed a ‘white privileged male’ by university lecturer Rachel Boyle during a debate on Meghan. Reacting to claims that the Duchess had been driven out of the UK by racism, the Lewis star, 41, defended Britain as the ‘most tolerant, lovely country in Europe’ and added: ‘It’s so easy to throw the card of racism at everybody and it’s really starting to get boring now.’ The Harrow-educated actor, the son of screen veteran James Fox, has long relished the chance to ruffle feathers, once declaring: ‘I feel compelled to be mean to the wokies.’
