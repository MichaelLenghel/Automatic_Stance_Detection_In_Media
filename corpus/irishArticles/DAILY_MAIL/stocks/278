TOKYO, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Japanese government bond (JGB) prices ticked lower on Wednesday, taking cues from a recovery in domestic equities and on caution ahead of a 20-year Japanese government bond auction. Benchmark 10-year JGB futures fell 0.09 point to 152.69, retreating from one-week high of 152.83 hit on Tuesday. The 10-year JGB yield rose 0.5 basis point to minus 0.050%, compared with a two-week low of minus 0.055% hit in the previous session. The 20-year JGB yield rose 1.5 basis points to 0.240%. Investors refrained from buying ahead of the auction of 900 billion yen ($8.18 billion) 20-year JGBs that will take place on Thursday. The 30-year JGB yield rose 1.5 basis points to 0.365%. In contrast, shorter maturities were resilient. The two-year JGB yield fell 0.5 basis point to minus 0.160%, while the five-year yield was flat at minus 0.150%. Japanese shares on Wednesday recouped some losses incurred in the previous session due to Apple's revenue warning. ($1 = 110.02 yen) (Reporting by Tokyo Markets Team; editing by Uttaresh.V)
