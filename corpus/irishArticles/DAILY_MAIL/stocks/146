NEW YORK, Feb 21 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell and the Nasdaq had its worst daily percentage decline in about three weeks on Friday as a spike in new coronavirus cases and data showing a stall in U.S. business activity in February fueled investors' fears about economic growth. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 227.3 points, or 0.78%, to 28,992.68, the S&amp;P 500 lost 35.55 points, or 1.05%, to 3,337.68 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 174.38 points, or 1.79%, to 9,576.59.
