By Pratima Desai LONDON, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Prices of industrial metals bounced on Tuesday as funds cut bets on lower prices, though the mood was dominated by worries over demand in top consumer China, where the coronavirus outbreak is expected to sap demand. Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange closed 1.4% up at $5,745 a tonne. Prices of the metal seen by investors as a gauge of economic health fell to a five-month low of $5,523 last week, representing a 13% decline since Jan. 16. "It's only a minor correction, there is nothing fundamental behind it," BMO Capital analyst Timothy Wood-Dow said of Tuesday's change. "There is a lot of uncertainty. We need to wait until the end of the week, maybe even next week, to see a clearer picture of what is going on in China." VIRUS: China's coronavirus outbreak could peak soon, a prominent Chinese expert said, as the death toll climbed above 1,000. He added that the number of new cases was already declining in some provinces. Traders said these comments and the reopening of some factories in China were partly behind funds covering their short positions on base metal prices. "News out of China that the rate of infection has dropped from the previous day could be giving investors a signal that they can perhaps start to discount some closure to this tragic crisis," said ED&amp;F Man Capital Markets analyst Edward Meir. CHARGES: Treatment and refining charges paid by miners to smelters to process copper ore into refined metal &lt;AM-CN-CUCONC>, climbed to $62.50 a tonne and 6.25 cents a lb on Monday, as assessed by industry pricing and information provider Asian Metal. SPREADS: The premium for cash zinc over the three-month contract &lt;CMZN0-3> has turned into a discount because of rising stocks in LME-registered warehouses &lt;MZNSTX-TOTAL>. At 72,025 tonnes, stocks are up 45% since early last week. That number is only a fraction of global demand estimated at about 14 million tonnes this year, but expectations are for more zinc to be delivered to exchange warehouses. "The rebalancing of the zinc market may have been brought forward by the coronavirus outbreak, as prices come under pressure amid the recent stock surge," ING analysts said. "As stocks continue to climb, there would be a stronger mandate to short (sell) zinc and a broad bearish case is likely to unfold sooner (rather) than later." Stocks in warehouses monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange &lt;ZN-STX-SGH> are also up, near 100,000 tonnes from close to 28,000 tonnes at the end of December. OTHER METALS: Aluminium was up 1.9% at $1,734 a tonne, zinc rose 0.6% to $2,148, lead added 3% to $1,850, tin climbed 0.9% to $16,475 and nickel was up 1.8% at $13,110.
