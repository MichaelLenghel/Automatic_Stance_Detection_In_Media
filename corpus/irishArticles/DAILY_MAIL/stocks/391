HONG KONG, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Hong Kong stocks edged up on Friday, as the daily death and infection tolls in the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak returned to lower levels, following a dramatic spike the previous day. ** At the close of trade, the Hang Seng index was up 0.3% at 27,815.60, up 1.5% week-on-week.
