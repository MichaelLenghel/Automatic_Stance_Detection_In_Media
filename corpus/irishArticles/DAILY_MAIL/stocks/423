Feb 13 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes slipped from record highs at the open on Thursday as a sharp increase in the number of deaths and cases related to the coronavirus outbreak in China sent investors scurrying for safe-haven assets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 115.39 points, or 0.39%, at the open to 29,436.03. The S&amp;P 500 opened lower by 13.55 points, or 0.40%, at 3,365.90 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 68.92 points, or 0.71%, to 9,657.04 at the opening bell.
