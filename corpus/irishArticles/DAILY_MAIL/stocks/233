Feb 20 (Reuters) - Copper prices rose on Thursday after top consumer China's monetary measures to prop up its virus-hit economy lifted expectations of higher demand for the metal. While the country's central bank reduced its one-year and five-year loan prime rates, copper's gains were checked as the move was widely expected. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange rose as much as 0.8% to $5,814 a tonne before easing to $5,786.50 a tonne by 0218 GMT, up 0.3%. The most-traded copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange advanced 0.04% to 46,240 yuan ($6,599.02) a tonne, having risen as much as 0.4%.
