SHANGHAI/HONG KONG, Feb 14 (Reuters) - China stocks advanced on Friday, on course for their first weekly gain in four, as the daily death toll in Hubei - the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak - halved and the number of new cases dropped. ** At the midday break, the Shanghai Composite index was up 0.5% at 2,921.25 points, while the blue-chip CSI300 index climbed 0.8%. The Shanghai index gained 1.6% so far this week, while the CSI300 index rose 2.4% for the week. ** CSI300's financial sector sub-index traded higher by 1.3%, the consumer staples sector rose 0.7%, the real estate index gained 1.6% and the healthcare sub-index edged up 0.6%. ** Chinese H-shares listed in Hong Kong rose 0.6%, while the Hang Seng Index was up 0.6% at 27,895.49. ** The smaller Shenzhen index rose 0.8% and the start-up board ChiNext Composite index was higher by nearly 1%, after hitting a fresh three-year high in the morning session. ** Officials said on Friday the number of new coronavirus deaths and infections was down sharply from the previous day, when a change in the methods of diagnosing patients led to a record spike in cases. ** Shanxi Securities said in a note that the expectation of loosening monetary policy will continue to help equities, even as disruption to production hurts earnings.
