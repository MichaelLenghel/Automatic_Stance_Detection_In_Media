Shoe designer Jasmine Yarbrough has started to stock up on nappies and onesies, as she prepares to welcome her first child. The 36-year-old wife of Today host Karl Stefanovic revealed on Thursday that she has been buying Huggies diapers, sharing a snap of her collection to Instagram. Jasmine and Karl, 45, are believed to be expecting a daughter in May. The Mara & Mine co-founder shared a picture of the nappies and a white onesie to her Instagram Story, alongside the caption: 'Thank you for my delivery, Huggies.' Karl is already father to three older children, Jackson, 20, Ava, 14, and River, 12, whom he shares with ex-wife Cassandra Thorburn.  Karl and Jasmine are believed to be expecting a little girl in May.   According to The Sunday Telegraph, the pair held a lavish gender reveal party at Crown Melbourne in January.   Also last month, Jasmine showed off her baby bump as she filmed a fun TikTok video with Karl's teenage daughter, Ava. Ava stuffed a pillow under her green sweater to pretend she was also pregnant as a rap track played in the background.  Jasmine has kept her pregnancy journey relatively private so far, with no bump photos being uploaded to her personal Instagram account. Photos taken of her in a swimsuit in Byron Bay on December 14 confirmed speculation the couple were excepting their first child together. Karl later announced the news via Instagram by writing: 'After a great deal of speculation...the rumours are true.'
