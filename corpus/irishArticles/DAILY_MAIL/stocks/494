By Naveen Thukral SINGAPORE, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Chicago wheat slid for a third straight session on Wednesday to its lowest since mid-December, weighed down by a U.S. government forecast of bigger-than-expected world inventories. Soybeans eased as the market was pressured by concerns over demand from top importer China, where the coronavirus epidemic has claimed more than 1,100 lives and turned bustling cities into ghost towns. "Wheat prices rallied in January but the world still has ample supplies and it hard for the market to sustain those gains," said Phin Ziebell, agribusiness economist at National Australia Bank. "There is disruption in grains trade in China because of the coronavirus which is adding pressure on prices. The question is how long before China starts truing the tap on agriculture imports?" The most-active wheat contract on the Chicago Board Of Trade (CBOT) was down 0.2% at $5.41 a bushel by 0317 GMT, after dropping to its weakest since Dec. 16 earlier in the session. Soybeans were down 0.1% at $8.84 a bushel and corn lost 0.1% to $3.79-1/4 a bushel. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in a monthly report trimmed its forecast for 2019-20 world wheat ending stocks to 288.03 million tonnes, nearly unchanged from 288.08 million previously. Analysts surveyed by Reuters on average had expected a bigger reduction to 287.44 million tonnes. The USDA left its forecast for U.S. 2019-20 corn ending stocks unchanged at 1.892 billion bushels, while analysts surveyed by Reuters on average expected a reduction. The government cut its forecast for U.S. 2019-20 soybean ending stocks to 425 million bushels, from 475 million previously, citing increased export demand from China even as concerns about the virus persist. The coronavirus outbreak could reduce Chinese purchases of U.S. agricultural products this year under the Phase 1 trade deal signed by the countries, White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien said on Tuesday. The USDA raised its estimate for Brazil's soybean crop to 125 million tonnes, up 2 million from January, and raised its forecast for global 2019-20 soy ending stocks. Egypt's main state wheat buyer purchased 360,000 tonnes of Russian and Romanian wheat in an international tender at prices that were down roughly $6 a tonne from what was paid at its last wheat tender on Jan. 30. Commodity funds were net sellers of CBOT corn, wheat and soymeal futures contracts on Tuesday and net buyers of soyoil and soybeans, traders said.
