By Sethuraman N R BENGALURU, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Indian stocks fell for a third straight session on Tuesday as concerns over the coronavirus outbreak hit risk sentiment, while U.S. President Donald Trump's two-day visit did little to cheer investors. The blue-chip NSE Nifty 50 index ended 0.27% lower at 11,797.90, while the S&amp;P BSE Sensex shed 0.2% to end at 40,281.20. The Nifty index tumbled 2.1% and the Sensex plunged nearly 2% on Monday, in a global market selloff sparked by fears of a greater impact on economic growth from the rapid spread of the coronavirus outside China. "Markets are quite shy of the near term and (worried about) what havoc coronavirus can play in terms of supply chain and global growth," said Saurabh Jain, assistant vice president research, SMC Global Securities. There was nothing much for the markets beyond the defence deals from Trump's visit, Jain added. India and the United States were making progress on trade, energy and military deals, U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd was the biggest gainers in the NSE index, rising 1.93%, while Dr.Reddy's Laboratories Ltd was the major laggard, falling 2.81%. The NSE index is off 5.1% from its lifetime high hit on Jan. 20, weighed down by the coronavirus outbreak and a lacklustre federal budget.
