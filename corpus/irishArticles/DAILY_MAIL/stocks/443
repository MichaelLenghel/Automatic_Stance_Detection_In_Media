SHANGHAI/HONG KONG, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Shares in China fell on Thursday, recoiling after a week-long streak of gains, after new cases of the coronavirus soared and death toll leapt at the epicentre of the outbreak. ** At the midday break, the Shanghai Composite index was down 0.5% at 2,911.35 points.
