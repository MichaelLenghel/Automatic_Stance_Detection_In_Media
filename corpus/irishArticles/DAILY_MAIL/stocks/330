SYDNEY, Feb 18 (Reuters) - U.S. wheat futures rose more than 1.5% on Tuesday to an 8-day high as fears over global production grew after Australia said output had fallen to its lowest level since 2008. FUNDAMENTALS * The most active wheat futures on the Chicago Board Of Trade were up 1.5% at $5.50-1/2 a bushel by 0115 GMT, near the session high of $5.58 a bushel - the highest since Feb 10. Wheat closed down 0.3% on Friday. * Markets were closed on Monday for a U.S. public holiday. * The most active soybean futures were down 0.4% at $8.90-1/4 a bushel, having closed down 0.3% on Friday. * The most active corn futures were up 0.2% at $3.78-1/2 a bushel, having closed down 0.5% in the previous session. * Australia said on Tuesday its 2019/2020 wheat harvest was the lowest in 12 years, missing its forecast, as a severe drought across the east coast wilted crops. * Ukraine's grain exports are up 24.5% at 38.4 million tonnes so far in the 2019/20 July-June season, the Ministry for Development of Economy, Trade and Agriculture said on Monday. * Brazilian soybean production in the 2019/2020 cycle is expected to reach a record 125.6 million tonnes, agribusiness consultancy AgRural said on Monday, as more than a fifth of the planted area has now been harvested. * Brazilian truck drivers began protesting early on Monday at Latin America's largest port in Santos, affecting the unloading of shipments and arrival of trucks at the port, the union representing some of the protesters said. MARKET NEWS * The euro traded near a three-year low versus the dollar ahead of a highly watched German survey on Tuesday that is expected to show a sharp slump in investor confidence and fuel growing pessimism about the outlook for Europe's largest economy. * Oil prices inched up on Monday as concerns over the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak in China were offset by expectations that potential production cuts from major producers could tighten global crude supply. * The S&amp;P 500 ended modestly higher on Friday following strong earnings from Nvidia and a report late in the session that the White House was considering a tax incentive for Americans to buy stocks.
