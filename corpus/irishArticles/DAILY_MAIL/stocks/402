TOKYO, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Japanese stocks dropped on Friday as renewed worries about a coronavirus outbreak in China supported demand for the safe-haven yen and weighed on export-oriented shares. The benchmark Nikkei average fell 0.5% to 23,704.59 by the midday break, while the broader Topix dropped 0.6% to 1,702.50. "Until Wednesday, people had been saying that you can buy shares because the number of new cases had peaked out. The reality seems to be quite different. An early end to this seems improbable," said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. In its latest update, China's Hubei province health commission said on Friday that it had recorded 116 deaths and 4,823 new cases of the flu-like virus that emerged in the provincial capital, Wuhan, in December. Japan, which confirmed its first coronavirus death on Thursday, is one of the worst affected of more than two dozen countries and territories outside mainland China that have seen hundreds of infections from the flu-like sickness. "Investors will surely avoid Asia for the time being and will shift funds to the U.S., geographically the most separated from the region," he said. That meant more demand for the safe-haven yen in the currency exchange market, which serves as a headwind for Japanese exporters' shares. All but three of the 33 sector sub-indexes on the Tokyo Stock Exchange were trading lower, with iron and steel , oil and coal products and construcion becoming the worst three performers. Nissan Motor Co Ltd dived 9.3% after the automaker cut its annual operating profit forecast by 43%, hit by a slump in vehicle sales and heaping more pressure on new management to rebuild the company after Carlos Ghosn's ouster. Bucking the overall weakness, SUMCO Corp jumped 7.0% after the semiconductor silicon wafer maker projected its operating profit for the January-March quarter to fall by 54.6% year-on-year but said supply-demand conditions for 200mm wafers are tightening.
