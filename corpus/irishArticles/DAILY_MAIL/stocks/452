SYDNEY, Feb 13 (Reuters) - U.S. soybean futures fell for the first time in nine sessions on Thursday as a sharp increase in the number of deaths due to the coronavirus outbreak in China stoked fears about demand from the world's No. 1 importer. FUNDAMENTALS * The most-active soybean futures on the Chicago Board of Trade were down 0.1% at $8.91-1/2 a bushel by 0101 GMT, having firmed 0.9% on Wednesday when prices hit a Jan. 30 high of $8.93 a bushel. * Corn futures fell 0.2% to $3.82-1/4 a bushel, having gained 0.9% in the previous session. * Wheat futures were unchanged at $5.47-1/2 a bushel, having closed up 1% on Wednesday after prices had earlier hit a Dec. 16 low of $5.38-1/4 a bushel. * The number of deaths in China's central Hubei province from the virus outbreak jumped by 242 to 1,310 as of Wednesday, the province's health commission said on Thursday. * The coronavirus outbreak could reduce Chinese purchases of U.S. farm goods, White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien said on Tuesday * But China has not informed the United States of any delays or reductions of its planned purchases due to the outbreak, USDA Under Secretary of Trade Ted McKinney said. * The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in a monthly report on Tuesday trimmed its forecast for 2019-20 world wheat ending stocks to 288.03 million tonnes, nearly unchanged from 288.08 million previously. * Analysts surveyed by Reuters on average had expected a bigger reduction to 287.44 million tonnes. MARKET NEWS * Asian stock markets wobbled and the safe-havens of the Japanese yen, gold and bonds rose as the number of new coronavirus cases at the outbreak's epicentre jumped sharply. * The yen rose from a three-week low against the dollar on Thursday after the sharp jump in death toll and new confirmed cases in China's Hubei province jolted markets and sparked a flight for safe-haven assets. * Oil prices edged up on hopes of OPEC output cuts, although gains were capped following the surge in death toll from the virus outbreak in China. * Wall Street closed at record highs on Wednesday.
