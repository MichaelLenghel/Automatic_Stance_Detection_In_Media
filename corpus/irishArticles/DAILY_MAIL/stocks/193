U.S. stocks spun lower in a dizzying day of trading Thursday as worries about the viral outbreak that started in China knocked the S&P 500 off its record high. The market started the day higher following another round of stronger-than-expected reports on the U.S. economy, but it slumped suddenly in the late morning only to pare its losses later. Market watchers didn´t see one clear trigger for the movements, which were reminiscent of the market´s sudden shifts during the height of the U.S.-China trade war. Several companies warned of the hit to profits they're expecting due to the virus. On Thursday: The S&P 500 index fell 12.92 points, or 0.4%, to 3,373.23. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 128.05 points, or 0.4%, to 29,219.98. The Nasdaq lost 66.21, or 0.7%, to 9,750.96. The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks rose 3.50 points, or 0.2%, to 1,696.07. For the week: The S&P 500 is down 6.93 points, or 0.2%. The Dow is down 178.10 points, or 0.6%. The Nasdaq is up 19.79 points, or 0.2%. The Russell 2000 is up 8.49 points, or 0.5%. For the year: The S&P 500 is up 142.45 points, or 4.4%. The Dow is up 681.54 points, or 2.4%. The Nasdaq is up 778.36 points, or 8.7%. The Russell 2000 is up 27.60 points, or 1.7%.
