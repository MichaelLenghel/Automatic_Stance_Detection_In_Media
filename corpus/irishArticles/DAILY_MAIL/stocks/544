BUCHAREST, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Here are news stories, press reports and events to watch which may affect Romanian financial markets on Tuesday. INFLATION FORECASTS Romanian central bank Governor Mugur Isarescu holds a news conference to present the latest inflation forecasts for this year and 2021 from 0900 GMT. AVERAGE WAGE DATA Romania's National Statistics Board to release average wage data for December at 0700 GMT. MACRO POLL The median forecast of a Reuters poll of analysts puts Romanian inflation at 3.6% year-on-year at the end of January, down from December's 4.0%.

DEBT TENDER Romania's finance ministry sold a more than planned 1.26 billion lei ($289.53 million) worth of June 2024 bonds on Monday at an average yield of 3.68%, central bank data showed. GOVERNMENT Romania's opposition Social Democrat Party (PSD) said on Monday they would go to court to challenge President Klaus Iohannis's move to renominate the ousted Ludovic Orban as prime minister, which could derail plans to trigger an early election.

The decree will be sent for debate in the lower house, which has the final say. www.g4media.ro For other related news, double click on: --------------------------------------------------------------- Romanian equities RO-E E.Europe equities .CEE Romanian money RO-M Romanian debt RO-D Eastern Europe EEU All emerging markets EMRG Hot stocks HOT Stock markets STX Market debt news DBT Forex news FRX For real-time index quotes, double click on: Bucharest BETI Warsaw WIG20 Budapest BUX Prague PX -------------------------------------------------------
