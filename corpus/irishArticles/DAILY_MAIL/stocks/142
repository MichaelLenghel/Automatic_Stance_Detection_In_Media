The yield on the 30-year Treasury reached a record low as investors sought the safety of U.S. government bonds. The price of gold also rose. Technology companies, which have much greater exposure to China than other industries, fell the most. On Friday: The S&P 500 index fell 35.48 points, or 1.1%, to 3,337.75.
