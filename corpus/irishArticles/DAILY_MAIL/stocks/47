Cameron Green's stocks have continued to rise, with the gun youngster hitting an unbeaten 158 in the Sheffield Shield as Western Australia tightened their grip on Tasmania in Hobart. The Tigers were 5-188 at stumps on day two in reply to the visitor's first innings of 371, headlined by Green's highest first-class knock. The 20-year-old, touted as Australia's long-term Test allrounder, resumed on Tuesday on 105 and combined nicely with the tail to frustrate Tasmania in the morning session. He finished with 19 fours and two sixes in the 283-ball innings, his third first-class century of the season. Green eclipsed his unbeaten 121 against Queensland and 126 against South Australia from earlier this summer and has 617 runs for WA this season at an average of 77.12. "Up there, if not at the top to be honest," Green said of the Bellerive Oval innings. "(I'm) really proud, I don't think I've ever batted 200 balls before." Green has been unable to bowl since before the Big Bash due to a back stress fracture and won't for the remainder of the Shield season. The silver lining is it has allowed him to concentrate on his batting. "It does clear your mind. When you're doing both, if you don't bat so well you can make up for it while bowling," he said. "If you're batting, you've got to fully concentrate on your batting because you can't obviously make up for it." The Tigers survived half an hour to lunch but their shaky batting was exposed afterwards, predominantly by quicks Joel Paris (2-27) and David Moody (2-55). Charlie Wakim has top-scored with 57 but none of his fellow top-order players capitalised on starts. Batting at No.6, Test skipper Tim Paine was out for 21 when he skewed an attempted pull shot to mid-off. Ben McDermott (20 from 78 balls) battened down the hatches and was unbeaten alongside Beau Webster (34 from 46) who mounted a counterattack in the shadow of stumps. Earlier, Sam Rainbird (5-77) was the pick of the Tigers' quicks, while Nathan Ellis finished with three scalps on debut.
