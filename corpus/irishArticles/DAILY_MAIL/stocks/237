Southern Cross Media's stocks have soared more than 13 per cent after it turned a net loss of $119.3 million last year into a first-half profit of $20.4 million, though the company remains mired in a tough ad market. The Melbourne-based media firm, which owns Fox FM and Triple M, saw its revenue fall by 8.2 per cent to $308.1 million in the six months to December 31, while earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation fell by 27.7 per cent to $67.5 million. Southern Cross - which now operates 96 radio stations and 105 TV signals across 35 markets - cited a broad "advertising contraction" which it said impacted all markets and segments -including audio and television. The company in October had flagged first half earnings could fall by as up to 27 per cent on account of the unpredictable market. Total underlying earnings fell 26.7 per cent to $62.2 million, in line with this guidance. Audio revenue dipped 8.4 per cent to $210.9 million, with earnings in the segment falling 23.8 per cent to $61.1 million. TV revenue fell 8.1 per cent to $96.2 million, with earnings down 19.6 per cent to $13.1 million. However, Southern Cross Media's digital audio revenues grew 140 per cent compared with last year, led by podcast network PodcastOne Australia and the firm's sales representation for SoundCloud. Chief executive Grant Blackley said audio was an attractive platform for audiences and advertisers and was well positioned to benefit from improvements in media markets. He said total average audiences for metro radio grew in 2019, while the average time spent listening remained stable. "Consumption of digital audio is growing strongly, providing opportunities for growing revenue through premium addressable advertising," Mr Blackley told the ASX on Thursday. "With an aggregated commercial reach of over three million monthly users, SCA offers advertisers scaled and simple solutions to target consumer interests, behaviours and passions." Meanwhile, the company's television business reduced underlying expenses by six per cent after outsourcing non-core functions, a move which reportedly cushioned the impact of lower spending by advertisers. Southern Cross Media announced an interim fully franked dividend of 2.75 cents per share, down from 3.75 cents the year before. The company's stocks had risen by 10 cents, or 13.25 per cent, to 85.5 cents at 1236 AEDT.
