HONG KONG, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares rose on Tuesday as the pace of new coronavirus infections in mainland China slowed, providing some respite to investors in the city and across the region. ** The Hang Seng Index climbed 1.3% to 27,583.88 points, their highest since Jan. 24. H-shares rose 1.5%. ** The Hang Seng sub-index tracking the energy sector rose 0.8%, the information technology sector gained 1.3%, the financial sector was also up 1.3%, while the property sector firmed 0.9%. ** There were 2,478 new confirmed cases in mainland China on Feb. 10, down from 3,062 on the previous day, bringing the total to 42,638. ** The top percentage gainer on the Hang Seng was Geely Automobile Holdings, up 5.7%, while the biggest loser was Hengan International Group, down 2.3%. ** Shares of e-commerce giant Alibaba dropped 2.5% in Hong Kong after a Bloomberg report said the company will not be allowed to join the Stock Connect trading link, which grants mainland China and Hong Kong equity investors mutual access. ** China's central bank should consider lowering its benchmark deposit rate to enable banks to reduce lending rates and help small businesses weather the economic fallout from the fast-spreading coronavirus, a central bank advisor said. ** "Adjusting for modest earnings growth downgrade, a further 7-8% index decline from present index level will present a very compelling entry opportunity," Union Bancaire Privee said in a note this week. ** Investors will also be keeping an eye on remarks by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell at a Congress testimony later on Tuesday.
