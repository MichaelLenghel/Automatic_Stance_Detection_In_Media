 Milla Jovovich draped her bulging baby bump in a floral dress while out with her husband Paul W.S. Anderson in Los Angeles this week. The star is expecting her third child.  The Kiev-born 44-year-old strolled hand in hand with her man as they headed into a Japanese restaurant to enjoy a spot of lunch. Milla teamed her dress with a pair of black leggings and some attractive suede shoes, carrying one of her beloved pooches in a handbag. Her husband was at the ready with a second bag, a stylish Gucci number that complemented his medallion necklace. The movie star announced her pregnancy last August and revealed her complex emotions, given she had to have an emergency abortion two years prior. 'After I found out I was pregnant 13 weeks ago, I had a mixture of feelings ranging between complete joy and utter terror. Because of my age and losing the last pregnancy I didn’t want to get attached to this potential baby too quickly,' she said. 'That was obviously not fun and the last few months have been my family and I living on pins and needles waiting for a slew of different test results to come in and spending most of our time in doctors offices.  'Thank goodness we’re in the clear AND we found out that we’ve been blessed with another girl!' Paul and Milla welcomed their daughter Ever in 2007, got married in 2009 and then in 2015 brought their son Dashiel into the world. Milla's first husband was her Dazed And Confused co-star Shawn Andrews, whom she tied the knot with in 1992 during filming, only to annul the marriage. Her next husband was French director Luc Besson, who has denied accusations of sexual assault and harassment. Milla famously starred in the film franchise of the Resident Evil video games, in movies directed by her current husband.
