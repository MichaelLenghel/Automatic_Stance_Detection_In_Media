The choking fug of tobacco smoke that hung over pubs and restaurants was snuffed out back in 2007. Now the smoking ban has been voted the UK’s greatest public health achievement of the 21st century. The Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) said that the ban has had a ‘profound impact’ in both reducing damage from passive smoking and de-normalising lighting up in public. Their list, based on votes from health sector experts, ranked the ‘sugar tax’ second.  The levy on soft drinks based on sugar content was introduced in 2018 as part of the Government’s childhood obesity plan. In third place was the Marmot Review into health inequalities from 2010, followed by Sure Start children’s centres. RSPH chief executive Shirley Cramer said: ‘This ranking unambiguously makes the case that prevention is better than the cure.’ 1. The smoking ban 2. The soft drinks industry levy (sugar tax) 3. Marmot review into health inequalities and understanding of the social determinants of health 4. Sure Start children’s centres (2000-2010) 5. Minimum Unit Pricing on alcohol in Scotland 6. HPV vaccination for boys and girls 7. Congestion charge and ultra-low emission zone 8. Decriminalisation of abortion in Northern Ireland 9. Wellbeing of Future Generations Act in Wales 10. Tobacco advertising bans 11. Traffic light labelling on pre-packaged food 12. Transferal of public health into local authorities 13. Scores on the doors food hygiene ratings 14. MIND’s Time to Change campaign 15. Fixed-odds betting terminals stake limit reduced to £2 16. Introduction of childhood flu vaccine 17. Reduction in homelessness between 2003 and 2009 18. Junk food advertising ban during children’s TV and across London transport network 19. Drug safety testing at festivals and nightclubs 20. Cancer screening improvements
