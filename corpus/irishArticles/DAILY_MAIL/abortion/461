Roman Catholic leaders effectively warned their four million UK followers not to vote Labour yesterday. They declared that Catholics should back only candidates who uphold the rights of unborn children. It follows Labour's vow to 'decriminalise' abortion by ending all legal restrictions, including the 24-week limit that bans it during the final months of pregnancy. Previous Labour leaders treated abortion as a matter of conscience and allowed free votes but Jeremy Corbyn's manifesto turns it into a party issue for the first time and Labour MPs will be whipped during votes. After two days of debating in Leeds Catholic bishops called on voters to back candidates who would defend 'the child in the womb'. They also called for 'the cherishing of marriage' against a background of pledges from Labour and the Lib Dems to introduce a radical no-fault divorce law.
