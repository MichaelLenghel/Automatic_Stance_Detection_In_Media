Jenelle Evans' ex-husband Courtland Rogers has been arrested for felony larceny and drug possession. Rogers, who was married for two years to the Teen Mom star, is currently in jail following his arrest over the weekend in New Hanover County, North Carolina, according to TMZ.  Rogers has been booked for one count of felony larceny and one count of felony possession of a schedule I drug, according to the website.  Police have not revealed what drug Rogers allegedly possessed, but drugs that fall under schedule 1 category include heroin, morphine, and mescaline. In addition to the felony counts, Rogers is facing a misdemeanor for possession of drug paraphernalia and a schedule II drug. Substances that fall under schedule II include pain medications.  Sheriff's records say Rogers remains in jail on a $15,000 bond, according to TMZ. This is not Rogers' first brush with the law.    Rogers was arrested over the summer after officials said he violated probation in a prior drug case.  The star was also arrested a year earlier amid accusations he had assaulted a woman. Rogers does not share any children with his ex Evans, who he was married to from 2012 to 2014.    Evans revealed in her 2017 book Read Between the Lines: From the Diary of a Teenage Mom that she was pregnant with Rogers' child, and subsequently had an abortion, citing her health: 'I did what was best for my body at that time, and I have moved on from it.' The pair had a turbulent relationship, culminating in both of them being placed under arrest in 2013 in connection with domestic violence and possession of heroin. Evans remarried following her divorce from Courtland. She tied the knot with David Eason in 2017, but filed for divorce in 2019.
