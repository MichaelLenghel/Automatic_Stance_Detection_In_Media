Film and television producer Tony Garnett has died following a short illness at the age of 83. The renowned producer, from Birmingham, had a successful 13-year collaboration with Ken Loach, and worked on the classic British dramas Kes and Sally Come Home. His World Productions company said in a statement: 'After a short illness, Tony Garnett, the legendary TV & Film Producer and founder of World Productions, died around midday on January 12. 'Tony was a great man and an inspirational producer who will be sorely missed by everyone who knew him.' Mr Garnett, a passionate advocate of working class rights, lost both his parents as a young child. His mother died when he was five following a backstreet abortion.   His father took his own life shortly afterwards, leaving Garnett to be raised by relatives, before studying at Birmingham grammar school and then moving to London to study at UCL.     Garnett met Loach in the 1960s after starting out as an actor in a series of BBC historical plays.  But, after years of working for the BBC, he hit out against the corporation, arguing it was too London-centric and was uninterested in 'poor people' except to 'smirk at'.
