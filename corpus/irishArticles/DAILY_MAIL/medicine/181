There was more bad news for My Kitchen Rules on Monday.  The Daily Telegraph reported that the struggling cooking show had hit a new ratings low, down 45 per cent year-on-year in the five-city metro markets.  It has been pummeled by Channel Nine's Married At First Sight and Channel Ten's Australian Survivor: All Stars.  The Daily Telegraph reports that this year's premiere episode chalked up 498,000 viewers, compared to 819,000 for the season premiere last year. The lowest ratings so far were for the February 4 episode which pulled in 402,000 viewers. While the second episode scored the highest viewers, notching up 517,000. 'This is going to be a series that will be the worst in the ratings history of My Kitchen Rules,' media analyst Steve Allen said.  It comes after claims that Channel Seven's once-unbeatable cooking show will soon be cancelled, a network insider told Woman's Day this week. MKR's ratings, which recently plunged to a record low, are said to be untenable and Seven executives are 'pushing' to cancel it. A source told the magazine: 'MKR is no longer safe. There are people in power pushing to end the show for good.' Judge Manu Feildel will apparently be offered other roles within the network because he is 'worshipped over there'. Meanwhile, Colin Fassnidge will reportedly be given the opportunity to pursue 'passion projects'.   The fate of Pete Evans, whose views on health and conventional medicine have attracted controversy, is unknown. Daily Mail Australia has reached out to Channel Seven for comment.
