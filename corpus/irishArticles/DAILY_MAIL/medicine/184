Young star Will Pucovski will miss Australia A's clash with the England Lions as he battles to recover from a concussion. Pucovski suffered what is believed to have been his eighth concussion in a match for the Cricket Australia XI on February 2, and has not played since. "Will is recovering from the concussion and medical staff have assessed that he will not be available for the Australia A game or the next Sheffield Shield match," sports medicine manager Alex Kontouris said.
