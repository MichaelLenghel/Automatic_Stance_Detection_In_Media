Jars of preserved human remains including tongues and potentially a fetus were found in the crawlspace under the floorboards of a Florida home that once belonged to a university professor.  The jars were discovered during an inspection of the home's foundation in Gainesville's Brywood neighborhood off NW 16th Avenue.  Investigators found six to eight jars, some containing human tongues. One jar held what police think may be a fetus.  Each jar is labelled with a name and date and at least one of those jars dates back to the 1960s, according to WCJB.  The jars are now being analyzed by a medical examiner.   Investigators are now trying to determine if the jars are connected to research of the home's previous owner Dr. Ronald A Baughman, a former University of Florida researcher and current professor emeritus. His ex-wife says she forgot the jars were still in the home after Baughman, who specialized in the head and neck, brought his work home with him one day.   Baughman was hired as an assistant professor of oral medicine in the 1971, according to UF's College of Dentistry.    He published studies in the 1970s and 80s. Some of his research includes studies on canker sores, the lower jaw, research in orals cells in the mouth, oral herpes, and oral cancer, according to Research Gate.    'Six jars that we see and the jars, they're not really jars, they're more like pales, they're only a gallon-size, they're not very large,' Inspector Jorge Campos said.
