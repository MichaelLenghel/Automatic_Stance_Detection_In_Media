DUBAI, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Iran's foreign minister Javad Zarif said on Monday that the Swiss humanitarian channel is not a sign of the United States' goodwill, Iran's Student News Agency(ISNA) reported. The Swiss and U.S. governments on Thursday said a humanitarian channel to bring food and medicine to Iran has started trial operations to help supply Swiss goods to the struggling population without tripping over U.S. sanctions. "This is a small step and we thank the Swiss government for its efforts ... but this channel is not a sign of America's goodwill at all," ISNA quoted Zarif as saying.
