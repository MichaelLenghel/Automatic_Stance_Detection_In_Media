She recently declared herself be 'photographically better looking' now than when she had a more slender frame. And Jane Seymour, 68, appeared keen to show off her curvier – yet still enviably lithe – frame on Sunday, when she stepped out in head-turning style for the 28th annual Elton John AIDS Foundation Academy Awards viewing party in Los Angeles. The British-born actress exuded glamour as she arrived at West Hollywood Park in a form-fitting silver sequinned gown, which boasted a flowing train. The flattering sleeveless number boasted a plunging neckline and was teamed with a glittering array of jewellery, which included a bracelet, two sparkling rings and a pair of icicle drop earrings. Wearing her golden brown tresses in voluminous waves, the Dr Quinn, Medicine Woman star highlighted her good looks with a flattering palette of makeup that included deep pink lipstick and a smokey eyeshadow. Her outing at the star-studded soirée comes after the London-born former Bong girl admitted to Platinum magazine that she suffers from insecurities, as 'everyone does'. 'Right now, I look at myself and think, "Gosh, I weigh more than I'd like" but photographically I'm looking better than I did when I was thinner,' she said.  The star, who is set to welcome her 69th birthday on Saturday, added: 'The old adage that being thin makes you look older is true.' Mother-of-four Jane has previously stated she is happy to fly the flag for older women ageing gracefully, and refuses to have cosmetic procedures like Botox. She told Platinum: 'I tried it in the past and just looked in the mirror and thought, "You know, this is not going to work for me." 'As an actor, you need to move your face as well as your body, so why would you paralyse it?' She revealed her secret to looking youthful is 'simple things' like fast walking every day - which she enjoys doing on a beach when she's in Malibu and in a warm coat when she's marching around London. 'I do Pilates, Gyrotonics and light weights,' she added. 'But beauty-wise, I'm pretty low maintenance — except for getting my hair coloured every three to four weeks.  'People say women shouldn't have long hair over a certain age, but I've never done what everyone says.' Hollywood's awards season reaches its climax tonight, with a cliffhanger over the top prize after a season marked by dark horses, renewed anguish over diversity, and a South Korean underdog that could snatch victory from the biggest names in show business. While dark comic book movie Joker goes into the ceremony with a leading 11 nominations, it's the immersive World War One movie 1917 that has emerged as the film to beat in the best picture race after winning a slew of accolades in the last five weeks. Yet a win for 1917 is far from a foregone conclusion, with South Korean social satire Parasite and sentimental favorite Once Upon a Time in Hollywood from Quentin Tarantino also jostling for attention from the 8,000 voters of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Korean-language film Parasite seems certain to take the renamed best international feature Oscar and would make history if the black comedy about haves and have-nots in modern Seoul also takes home the best picture statuette. Martin Scorsese's mob saga The Irishman seems to have lost momentum despite lavish early praise and a cast that includes Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci. But it has failed to take home major acting or directing awards this season, likely dashing Netflix's best hope so far of picking up its first best picture Oscar. The best director category, a controversially all-male affair, is equally hard to call according to Oscar pundits, with a lineup featuring Sam Mendes (1917), Scorsese, Todd Phillips (Joker), Tarantino and Bong Joon Ho (Parasite). Some races appear to be already locked up. Brad Pitt has never won an acting award, but he has charmed awards audiences with his witty speeches and supporting actor performance as a laid-back stunt double in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Joaquin Phoenix has dominated best actor prizes for his terrifying portrayal of an isolated loner in Joker, while Renee Zellweger seems to have locked up best actress for playing an aging Judy Garland in Judy. A win by Zellweger would defeat Harriet star Cynthia Erivo, the only person of colour in the acting lineup that has renewed the #OscarsSoWhite furor despite four years of efforts to diversify the academy's membership. Taking place without a host for the second year, Oscar organizers have given few details of the ceremony, other than to announce live performances by original song contenders Elton John, Idina Menzel, Randy Newman, Chrissie Metz and Erivo. Five-time Grammy winner Billie Eilish will also take the stage for what is billed as a special performance that could see her debut her theme song for the upcoming James Bond movie No Time to Die.  BEST PICTURE  The Irishman Ford vs Ferrari Jojo Rabbit Joker Little Women Marriage Story 1917 Once Upon A Time...
