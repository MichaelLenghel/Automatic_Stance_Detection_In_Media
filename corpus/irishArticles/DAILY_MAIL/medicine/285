He's known for his bulky physique. And as he showed off his muscles following a grueling workout on Tuesday, Mark Wahlberg made sure to plug Australian fitness franchise, F45 - which he invested in last year. The actor surprised gym-goers by joining them at the Sherman Oaks location.   The 48-year-old actor was also seen posing with fans following the session. Mark rocked a rainbow tie-dye style T-shirt for the session.  He teamed the look with black shorts, colorful sneakers and a F45 Training cap on his head.  The star added a pair of workout gloves to avoid any blisters or hand injuries.  The 45 minutes saw Mark complete a strength session including weights, medicine balls, sandbags and bars for chin ups.  And post workout the former child star was seen posing with fans for photos.  Mark has also been getting his famous friends to come train with him.   Earlier in the month he enjoyed a sweaty session with Mario Lopez and his wife, Courtney Laine Mazza.  'My buddy and his better half hit it hard today,' he captioned.   And it was all about family time for Mark when he returned home from the gym on Tuesday.    'My buddy Benny!' he captioned. The selfie saw Mark sport the same tie-dye shirt while hugging his son, Brendan, 11.  The Wahlburgers owner began dating his wife, Victoria's Secret model, Rhea Durham in 2001.    The pair married in 2009 after welcoming three of their four children.  Mark and Rhea are parents to Ella Rae, 16, Michael, 13, Brendan, 11, and Grace Margaret, 10.
