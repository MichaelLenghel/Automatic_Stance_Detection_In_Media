Last week, shares in GlaxoSmithKline reached highs they haven't touched since 2001. That's perhaps a sign that investors are finally warming to plans outlined by boss Emma Walmsley to transform the British pharma company into a leaner, meaner, medicine-making machine.  And on Wednesday investors will get an update of how this is going when it reports full-year results. For years Glaxo has been seen as a laggard compared to faster-growing Astrazeneca, which has wowed the industry with its blockbuster cancer drugs, stealing a march on its arch-rival. But under Walmsley, Glaxo has ramped up its research efforts, snapped up innovative cancer specialist Tesaro, struck a deal to use genetic data in medicine trials and – most significantly – decided to spin off its consumer arm in 2022. But as ever, with spending on research now a priority, there will be questions about the company's dividend this week. Unchanged since 2014 at 80p, Walmsley has committed to paying it for the full year again – but there are no promises after that. But given that Walmsley has shown herself capable of taking radical decisions, this remains one to watch.
