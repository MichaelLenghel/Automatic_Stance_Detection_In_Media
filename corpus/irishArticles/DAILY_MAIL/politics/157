Former WA treasurer Troy Buswell has taken leave from work due to "health and family" reasons after he was charged with domestic violence offences. Buswell, whose political life was marred by scandals, is facing seven charges including aggravated assault occasioning bodily harm, aggravated common assault and unlawful damage. He was charged following an investigation by the Special Crime Family Violence Unit, with police alleging the offences happened between 2015 and 2019. Buswell, 53, is currently the chief executive at soil and mulch company Eclipse Soils. "Mr Buswell has taken leave for health and family reasons," a spokesman said in a statement on Friday. "He has been exemplary for the company since joining two years ago. "The company and its staff will continue to support Mr Buswell in any way it can." Veterans Affairs Minister Peter Tinley said it was deeply sad. "Mr Buswell made a good contribution in public life and I wish him the best," he told reporters. Buswell joined state parliament in 2005 but quit politics in 2014 following revelations he had a string of car crashes while returning home from a wedding in February that year. A one-time heir apparent to then-premier Colin Barnett, Buswell's other indiscretions included sniffing the chair of a Liberal staffer in 2008 and an affair with then-Greens MP Adele Carles in 2010. Buswell is due to face Perth Magistrates Court on March 4.
