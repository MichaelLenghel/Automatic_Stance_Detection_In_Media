Peter Stefanovic has returned to his breakfast TV job at Sky New Australia after taking two weeks off following the birth of his first child, son Oscar, with wife Sylvia Jeffreys. And on Tuesday the journalist, 38, revealed to The Daily Telegraph that he and Karl Stefanovcic, 45, (who hosts Today on Nine) often text each other during their respective breakfast shows.   'We chat during the shows sometimes. Sometimes it is just, 'What are you having for breakfast?' If we've got a guest on that they don't have, that is nice,' he said.  'Or if he has got a guest on that is someone we might be interested in like politicians, I will ask him how it went,' Peter added.  Peter, who recently welcomed his first child, a son named Oscar, with wife Sylvia Jeffreys,  added that his conversations with Karl often continue after their shows as well. Despite working for competing networks, Peter insisted that he and Karl don't see each other as competitors.   'That is what is great about him being back into that world because it is the same world that I am in; news and politics which is what he does so well, and sport, and we just share our views,' he said.  The Stefanovic brothers' return to screens comes after the pair made headlines after details in a conversation they had in an Uber about their colleagues and bosses at Nine was made public by the driver in 2018. Peter left Channel Nine after 15 years in December 2018.  In the same month, Karl was sacked while he was on his honeymoon in Aspen with new wife Jasmine Yarbrough.   Peter began co-hosting Sky News First Edition in May 2019.  Meanwhile, Karl returned to Today in January with a new team - Allison Langdon, newsreader Tracey Vo and sports presenter Alex Cullen.
