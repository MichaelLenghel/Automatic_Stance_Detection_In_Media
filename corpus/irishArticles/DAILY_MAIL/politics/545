WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump has tapped a retired North Carolina physician to be the next U.S. ambassador to Canada. Dr. Aldona Wos was nominated Tuesday to fill the role vacated by Kelly Craft, who is now the country's ambassador to the United Nations, news outlets reported. Wos must be confirmed by the Senate. In 2017, Wos was appointed by Trump to the President's Commission on White House Fellowships. She has also served as ambassador to Estonia under former President George W. Bush and as secretary of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services. During her time as North Carolina DHHS secretary, Wos faced challenges with the federal government over food stamps and questions about hiring practices, including an executive from her husband's firm, The News & Observer reported. Wos is married to Louis DeJoy, a major GOP fundraiser and donor. Wos gave more than $760,000 to Republican candidates and causes during the 2018 election cycle, The News & Observer reported citing the Center for Responsive Politics.
