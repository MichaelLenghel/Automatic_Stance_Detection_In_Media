As Me Activist Sinead Burke was the first person with achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism, to be featured on the cover of Vogue.  Each week she spends 45 minutes with an accomplished person to find out what it feels like to be them.  A good entry episode is the interview with Victoria Beckham who opens up about her battle to establish herself as a designer, when people saw her as little more than a WAG.   Americast There are countless podcasts about US politics and some get a bit lost in the weeds. This superb BBC show, hosted by old friends and journalists Emily Maitlis and Jon Sopel, is an invaluable guide to the forthcoming presidential election.  In each half-hour episode, the pair explain with humour and clarity just what is going on. They don’t assume prior knowledge and they even swear a bit to keep things loose. It’s charming and informative.   White Wine Question Time Each week, Kate Thornton gets two old pals together and asks them questions that go to the heart of their friendship.  Thornton and her guests allegedly drink three bottles of wine while they chat, though everyone always sounds suspiciously cogent. Start with the episode with author Lemn Sissay and Lisa Faulkner.   My Mother’s Murder In October 2017, Malta’s most prominent investigative journalist, Daphne Caruana Galizia, was killed by a car bomb.  The final words she wrote, half an hour before her death, were: ‘There are crooks everywhere you look now. The situation is desperate.’ In this gut-wrenching four-part podcast, her son, Paul, seeks to uncover who murdered her.
