Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick is out of the presidential race, meaning a trio of Democrats have called it quits in the hours after New Hampshire voters cast their ballots.  Deval made his exit official Wednesday after telling supporters at his Granite State primary night event that he needed to 'go home and rest and reflect on this outcome' after garnering just .4 per cent of the vote.  'I believed and still believe we had a strong case to make for being able to deliver better outcomes. But the vote in New Hampshire last night was not enough for us to create the practical wind at the campaign's back to go on to the next round of voting,' Patrick said in a statement obtained by CNN. 'So I have decided to suspend my campaign, effective immediately.'  Patrick had been the last black candidate competing in what was once a racially diverse Democratic field.   Patrick followed businessman Andrew Yang and Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet out the door.  Yang was the first candidate Tuesday night to announce he was done.  As his crowd chanted '2024!' Yang encouraged his #YangGang, 'We are just getting started.'  'This movement is the future of American politics,' he said. 'This movement is the future of the Democratic Party.'    While he consistenly polled in the single digits, Yang made history by being the most formidable Asian-American candidate to seek the White House. Prior to his run, he never served in elected office, coming from the tech world instead.  He centered his campaign around the concept of giving Americans a universal basic income - what he dubbed a 'freedom dividend' - $1,000 a month to citizens over 18 that they could spend however they want.      Minutes after Yang gave his final campaign speech,  Bennet announced he was dropping out of the race too, becoming the 20th Democrat to do so.  Bennet had a steep hill to climb, announcing his bid in May 2019, after many of the front-running candidates were already in. Like his fellow U.S. senators, he was also kept off the campaign trail in the vital weeks leading up to last Monday's Iowa caucuses thanks to President Trump's impeachment trial.  In New Hampshire, Bennet got help from longtime Democratic strategist James Carville, but it didn't do enough to keep him in.  'I love you New Hampshire, I do,' Bennet told his crowd Tuesday night. 'Whether you knew it or not, we were having a great time together,' he joked.  Patrick got in the presidential race even later, not announcing his bid until November 2019. He also decided to bypass the Iowa caucuses, focusing on New Hampshire instead, hoping he might get a boost from being a next-door-neighbor.  He did not.  It was clear he saw the writing on the wall Tuesday night.  'No matter whether it is a candidate for president, or as a public citizen. I'm going to stay involved,' Patrick told supporters then. 'No matter what decision we make tomorrow morning about the practical ability of this campaign to continue. I'm going to stay involved, and so must you.'  With Patrick's exit there are now just eight Demorats in the race, with a caucus in Nevada and a primary in South Carolina coming next. Twenty-one Democrats have already dropped out.  JOE BIDEN Age on Inauguration Day 2021: 78 Entered race: April 25, 2019 Career: No current role.
