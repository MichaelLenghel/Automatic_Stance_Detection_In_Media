Former NSW premier Barry O'Farrell has been named as Australia's next high commissioner to India. Mr O'Farrell, who led the state from 2011 to 2014, was forced to resign after admitting to misleading the corruption watchdog over a $3000 bottle of Grange. Since leaving state politics, Mr O'Farrell has served as NSW special envoy for India and as deputy chairman of the Australia India Council. Two-way trade between Australia and India is worth $30.7 billion. Mr O'Farrell is the third high-profile Liberal to be appointed to a major diplomatic post in recent months, with Arthur Sinodinos sent to Washington and Mitch Fifield deployed to the United Nations in New York.
