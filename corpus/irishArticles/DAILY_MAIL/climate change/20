MADRID, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Central banks' main objective on climate challenges should be to allow markets to correctly assess the risks, European Central Bank policymaker Pablo Hernandez de Cos said on Tuesday. "The central banks' main objective, jointly with other public agents, should be to allow the market to correctly assess climate risk," De Cos said. The ECB has started a one-year review of the ECB's policy framework. Finding a way to combat climate change has been one of the priorities of the ECB's president Christine Lagarde since taking office on Nov. 1. (Reporting By Jesús Aguado)
