A federal opposition frontbencher has described it as "incredible" that the Greens are putting Labor last on the how-to-vote card in the upcoming Johnston by-election in the Northern Territory. NT News says the Greens will preference the ALP below Territory Alliance and the Country Liberal Party, which federal Labor's Pat Conroy said would be a first. "It's certainly remarkable that this first has occurred only a week and a half after Adam Bandt was elected (the Greens) leader," Mr Conroy told AAP on Saturday. "Given they have preferenced the Country Liberal party ahead of us, who are climate change denials, I'm not sure what signal it is sending to their supporters." He said Mr Bandt claimed when he was elected he wanted to work with Labor to advance progressive policies. "I'm not sure how consist this is with that." NT Greens say the move was punishment for Labor's decision to lift the moratorium on onshore gas fracking. "We are encouraging our supporters to help sack the frackers by putting Labor last," NT Greens convener Jasmyn Sheppard told NT News. The Greens will divert their first preferences to the Ban Fracking Fix Youth Crime Protect Water Party, then the independents. They will put Labor below Territory Alliance -a party led by former CLP chief minister Terry Mills - and the CLP. "This dirty deal means the Greens are in bed with the CLP and they will help elect a CLP government with more job cuts and asset sales," Territory Labor secretary Anthony Brereton said. Comment was sort from Mr Bandt.
