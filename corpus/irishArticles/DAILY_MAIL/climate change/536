Ricky Gervais has slammed the stars who used their acceptance speeches to lecture about politics, human rights and animal welfare at Sunday's Academy Awards.  The comedian, 58, took to Twitter saying he 'tried to warn' the A-list stars not to preach, while viewers watching at home called the event the 'wokest Oscars ever'. Last month, Ricky delivered series of controversial and expletive-laden gags at the 77th Golden Globes awards ceremony and told the stars: 'If you win, come up, accept your little award, thank your agent, and your God and f*** off.'  Taking to Twitter on Monday, Ricky said: 'I have nothing against the most famous people in the world using their privileged, global platform to tell the world what they believe. I even agree with most of it. 'I just tried to warn them that when they lecture everyday, hard working people, it has the opposite effect. Peace.' Joaquin Phoenix, 45, and Brad Pitt, 56, led the chorus of celebrities giving sermons on human rights, animal rights and politics.   Phoenix, who is a passionate vegan, won the coveted Oscar award for Best Actor for his performance in the film Joker. He used his speech to talk about the artificial insemination of cows and how humans 'exploit' and 'dominate' animals.  'We feel entitled to artificially inseminate a cow and when she gives birth we steal her baby, even though her cries of anguish are unmistakable. 'And then we take her milk that's intended for her calf and we put it in our coffee and our cereal,' he said. Brad complained about President Trump's impeachment trial, Sigourney Weaver described 'all women' as 'superheroes', while a documentary filmmaker invoked Karl Marx and called for 'workers of the world' to 'unite'. Renee Zellweger gushed over the unifying qualities of 'our heroes' and Jojo Rabbit filmmaker Taika Waititi dedicated his award for Best Adapted Screenplay to 'all the Indigenous kids in the world. Pitt, while collecting the award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in Once Upon A Time in Hollywood, complained former national security adviser John Bolton did not testify at President Trump's impeachment trial. 'They told me I only had 45 seconds up here, which is 45 seconds more than the Senate gave John Bolton this week. 'I'm thinking maybe Quentin (Tarantino) does a movie about it and in the end the adults do the right thing,' he said. There were also political statements on the red carpet. Natalie Portman wore a cape with the names of female directors whose movies were overlooked this year, including Little Women director Greta Gerwig. 'I wanted to recognize the women who were not recognized for their incredible work, in my subtle way,' Portman said. Phoenix wore a Stella McCartney suit that he has worn to every other awards event to minimize waste, he said. He finished his acceptance speech quoting his brother, River, who he said told him when they were teenagers: 'Run to the rescue with love—and peace will follow.'  While the well-heeled crowd at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles applauded their speeches, their 'lectures' nauseated the audience at home. Many viewers took to Twitter to slam the stars as 'hypocrites' and called the event the 'wokest Oscars ever'. 'Ah the Oscars! A time for overpaid entertainers to lecture me about income inequality. 'A time for hypocrites to chastise me about carbon dioxide after they flew in on private jets. 'A time for beautiful tutored people to tell me I need more science learning on climate change,' one person mused. Another quipped: 'Celebrities show up to the Oscars wearing: $100,000+ gowns, $50,000+ jewelry, $5,000+ shoes and are worth millions. Only to lecture America on income inequality and claim they're oppressed?' Another user who dubbed it the 'wokest Oscars ever' called the event 'a complete waste of time and getting boring with statements from these idiots that no one cares about.'
