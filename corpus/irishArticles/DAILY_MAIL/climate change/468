While registrations of new cars slipped another 2.4 per cent in 2019 - declining for the third consecutive year and to the lowest point since 2013 - the market for used vehicles has remained relatively steady. A whopping 7.9 million second-hand cars were sold last year, down just 0.1 per cent (around 10,000 cars) on 2018. But can you guess which models were most in-demand?  Here's a countdown of the 10 cars that changed hands most in 2019... 2019 used transactions: 126,587 Renault's popular supermini didn't make it into the top 10 new models registered last year, but there's still big demand for them on the second-hand market. That might be because they're relatively cheap, depreciating quicker than some rivals as the infamous tag of being French and therefore not as reliable as other European and Japanese makers still hangs in the air. The latest Clio in showrooms is the fifth generation, with the first dating as far back as 1990. That means there is plenty of choice on the used market at varying prices.  2019 used transactions: 127,294 The Audi A3 has always been a popular second-hand model. Many drivers make the executive decision to let someone else incur the rapid depreciation of an A3 in the first year or two of ownership, then swoop when the prices fall to more affordable levels. Given that they have a premium finish and lots of badge appeal, many people would rather have one over a comparable Ford Focus of Vauxhall Astra. The A3 has also been around for some time; the first generation arriving in 1996. 2019 used transactions: 157,353 The latest iteration of the VW Polo was the ninth most-bought new car in 2019, and appetite for used models is equally as strong. More than 150,000 second-hand Polos switched owners last year, with older examples representing relatively affordable motoring with a grown-up feel. Of all the models featured in the list, the Polo is among the longest-serving, dating as far back as 1975 - though classic mk1 models, in good working order, will be appreciating assets these days. We're currently in the fifth generation of the popular Volkswagen supermini, but many being sold on the used market will be older examples. 2019 used transactions: 168,878 The Mini, for such a small car, isn't cheap. If you buy one from a showroom today it will cost from £16,195. That's not to say people won't purchase new ones - in fact, almost 45,000 were bought in 2019, meaning there are plenty entering the market. While historically the Mini range has depreciated relatively slowly, the BMW-made models have been on sale since 2001 and that now means there's a spread of value across the second-hand market. When you take into account how fashionable they have become, the increasing availability and range of prices, it's no surprise the Mini is among the most popular of all second-hand cars. 2019 used transactions: 184,470 The BMW 3 Series might have narrowly missed out on appearing in the list of the best-selling new cars of last year but it is well cemented as a popular second-hand choice. There's no shortage of them due to their popularity among fleets and leasing firms, who have to move them into the used market once they've passed a certain age or mileage. That means there are plenty of bargains for someone in the market for a premium German family car. Auto Trader currently has around 10,000 listed at the time of publishing.  Official figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show there was serious appetite for used petrol and diesel cars last year. Sales of second-hand diesels were down 0.6 per cent, which is nothing in comparison to the 22 per cent plunge in new registrations of oil burners. In fact, while just a quarter of new cars bought in 2019 were diesel, two in five second hand cars had diesel engines.  Appetite for used battery electric vehicles surged by 21.8 per cent in comparison, though to just 14,112 transactions, equivalent to just 0.2 per cent of the market. Combined, alternatively fuelled vehicles (hybrid, plug-in hybrid and battery electric) were up emphatically, increasing 23.4 per cent with 135,516 changing hands and accounting for 1.7 per cent of all sales.  Meanwhile, transactions of the latest, cleanest, Euro 6 models (available since 2015) were up 32.5 per cent as more of them reached the used market, helping to address air quality concerns as people looked to replace older models with those that will comply with the Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) in London and Clean Air Zones (CAZ) being deployed in other UK cities in 2020. Mike Hawes, chief executive at SMMT, said: 'A buoyant used car market is necessary to maintain strong residual values and, clearly, it is now outperforming the new car market.  'This does, however, suggest that weak consumer confidence and ongoing uncertainty over possible future restrictions on different vehicle technologies are causing some car buyers to hold off buying new models.  'This is delaying the fleet renewal we need now if we are to deliver immediate and continuous improvement in air quality and climate change.' 2019 used transactions: 243,746 There's a pretty significant jump in sales from the BMW 3 Series in sixth spot to the Vauxhall Astra in fifth - some 59,000 more, in fact. That's most likely due to pricing, with second-hand vehicle buyers able to get their hands on a far newer example of the Astra than they would a 3 Series when spending the same amount of money. The Vauxhall's popularity could start to go into decline, though - we've already seen it fall out of favour in new car sales, dropping out of the top 10 most popular models in the last couple of years. It will be interesting to see if this trend is mirrored on the used market.  2019 used transactions: 260,344 The Golf has been around in eight guises since 1974. That means there are lots of examples on the second-hand market. The family hatchback is now the second most-bought new car in the UK, so it comes as no shock that 260,000 used examples have been swapping hands over the previous 12 months. Like the 3 Series, the Golf is a fleet, leasing and hire-car favourite. That means there are lots of nearly-new versions flooding onto the market at all times. Hot hatch GTI models are still hugely sought after in all generations.  2019 used transactions: 293,276 Compared to most of the competition here, the Focus hasn't been around for that long. Originally launched in 1998 and now in its fourth generation, the Ford family hatchback is a relative new kid on the block. It's hugely popular though, both new and used. Depreciation hits pretty hard, meaning nearly new examples can be bought for a fraction of their retail price. First-generation cars are now starting to get thin on the ground and struggling to cope with the test of time, but you can still get your hands on robust second-generation cars.  2019 used transactions: 299,791 Superminis remained the most popular used buy of all car types, accounting for one in three of all second-hand models bought in 2019. That's far more than SUVs, which are growing in popularity on the new market - though there isn't a single example of one in this list. The Corsa is one of the superminis to benefit from this high level of appetite, mainly as motorists want a cheaper second runaround model for the family or a new driver and therefore turn to used adverts. Around since the early '90s, the little Vauxhall has become a mainstay on UK roads since the turn of the century.  2019 used transactions: 351,767 No surprises here - the most popular new car for the last 11 years is also the most in-demand second-hand model. There are currently over 13,000 examples of Fiestas of various generations for sale on Auto Trader, so there are more than enough to choose from. Having been on the scene since 1976 - yes, the Fiesta name has been around for 44 years - it has recently been the new and used car most Britons have turned to.  Examples built this side of the century have proven pretty robust, meaning you can get your hands on a cheap and relatively reliable small car if you're happy to have an older version.
