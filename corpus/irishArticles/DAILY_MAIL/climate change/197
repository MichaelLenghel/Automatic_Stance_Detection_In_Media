A Melbourne inner-city council will begin rolling out a new four bin system for waste management in a bid to reduce its carbon footprint. The City of Yarra Councillors voted on the new system this week and confirmed that households would receive two extra bins in July.  Mayor Cr Misha Coleman said: 'Yarra and its residents have long been a leader in environmental sustainability, responding to the climate emergency and this decision is consistent with that commitment.'  One rubbish bin will be introduced for food and green waste and will be collected weekly. Another new bin will be rolled out specifically for recycling glass.   These are in addition to the two general garbage and recycling bins already in place.   Cr Coleman explained that the food waste service would be collected weekly in order to remove the majority of materials that cause odours.  The glass, commingled recycling and landfill bins would be collected fortnightly in a bid to reduce overall waste.   The new waste and recycling collection model is based off a successful 2019 trial that used 1300 households in the inner-city suburb of Abbotsford.  The trial showed that about 60% of household waste was diverted from landfill.   'We started this trial because recycling in Australia is in crisis. It's time we did things very, very differently and councils and communities like ours are providing the leadership to drive change in this industry,' said Cr Coleman.  The new system will also provide each house with an extra 50 litres of waste capacity per week.
