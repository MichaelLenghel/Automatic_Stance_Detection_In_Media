Bendigo and Adelaide Bank has launched a $300 million capital raising and slashed its interim dividend as rising costs weigh heavily on its first-half result. The regional lender on Monday entered a trading halt ahead of its $9.34-per share placement and $50 million non-underwritten share purchase plan, which it initiated to strengthen its buffer above APRA's "unquestionably strong" capital ratio. The placement comes after the bank's first-half cash profit result slipped 2.0 per cent to $215.4 million, down from $219.8 million in HY19, weighed down by higher staff and redundancy costs, a higher regulatory and compliance spend, and an income hit following the sale of Bendigo Financial Planning. Bendigo Bank's institutional offer is at a 9.0 per cent discount to the bank's adjusted closing price of $10.26 on Friday, reflecting the absence of a 31 cent interim dividend, which has been cut from 35 cents a year ago. Chief executive Marnie Baker said the decision to cut the first-half dividend was "difficult" but "required, given the capital raising to ensure sustainability of the dividend, retain funds for growth and to enable us to continue to deliver our strategy." The capital raising follows a $275 million placement by mid-tier rivals Bank of Queensland in November and is expected to add approximately 67 to 81 basis points to the bank's level two Common Equity Tier 1 ratio. The bank said Common Equity Tier 1 improved by 24 basis points to 9.0 per cent during HY20. Statutory net profit fell by 28.2 per cent to $145.8 million during the period, reflecting $106.1 million in software impairments and software accelerated amortisation adjustments. Net interest income increased by $17.9 million, or 3.2 per cent, to $676.4 million, while the firm's net interest margin before revenue share arrangements increased by two basis points to 2.37 per cent. Total lending of $62.9 billion, was up 2.8 per cent on the prior corresponding period, though agribusiness lending fell 6.8 per cent on account of the rolling drought. Ms Baker said a housing market recovery had helped underpin an above-system mortgage lending growth of 7.7 per cent for the period, but conceded the financial landscape continued to suffer in the face of a number of uncertainties. These included climate change and increasingly severe weather events, drought, coronavirus disruptions, increased regulatory requirements, and sagging business confidence. She also warned that the bank's spend on technology and digital would increase before it began to ease. Bendigo said its digital bank Up, launched in partnership with Melbourne software firm Ferocia, added 165,000 customers during the half, an increase of 57 per cent. The app-based bank had $172 million in deposits, up 414 per cent from the prior half. Bendigo's total operating expenses were 5.0 per cent higher overall, with the bank's cost-to-income ratio rising 200 basis pints to 59.3 per cent. "We maintain our focus on reducing our cost base, which will require continued investment in digital and technology in the short term, before cost to income declines towards 50 per cent in the medium-term," Ms Baker told investors. Bendigo and Adelaide bank shares were last trading at $10.57 on the ASX.
