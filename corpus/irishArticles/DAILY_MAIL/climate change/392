The former head of a coal lobby group says Australia's historic ties to fossil fuels should not be in its future. Ian Dunlop, former chair of the Australian Coal Association, says coal has been the nation's "bugbear" and it was time for real change in favour of the climate. "We can't just keep saying because we've had coal ever since World War II, or longer, that's the way the world intended," he said ahead of the National Climate Emergency Summit in Melbourne on Friday.
