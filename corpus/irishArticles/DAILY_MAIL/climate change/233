Australian Federal Police dropped an investigation into whether Angus Taylor forged documents without interviewing the federal energy minister. Earlier this month, the AFP said they found no evidence Mr Taylor was involved in creating fake documents to attack Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore. AFP Commissioner Reece Kershaw confirmed the minister was not interviewed before his agency abandoned the investigation. "I'm not aware that the minister was interviewed or even offered an interview," Mr Kershaw told the National Press Club in Canberra on Wednesday. "We've been pretty clear in the decision making process that we came to, not being able to substantiate any offences being committed." At the time the investigation was dropped, the AFP pointed to the low level of harm, Mr Taylor's apology to Ms Moore and the significant amount of resources the investigation would require. In an attempt to attack the Sydney lord mayor over climate change, Mr Taylor sent a letter accusing Ms Moore of spending $15 million on domestic travel, but these figures were false. The council's 2017/18 annual report showed it spent just $1728 on international travel and $4206 on domestic trips. Labor referred the matter to NSW Police, who then referred it to the AFP. Mr Kershaw said his NSW counterpart didn't express a view to him about whether a crime had been committed. Ms Moore questioned the independence of the federal police after they dropped the investigation. "It seems to me that the police resources haven't been expended on looking for the evidence of who was responsible," she said.
