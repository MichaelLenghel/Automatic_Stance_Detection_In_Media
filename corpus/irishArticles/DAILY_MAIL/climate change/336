Barbra Streisand has signaled her support for Michael Bloomberg with a tweet touting the billionaire's philanthropic endeavors. The songstress shared a link to a New York Times investigation into how Bloomberg built his national influence through philanthropy on Saturday.  'A very generous man who puts his money where his mouth is... especially about climate change, gun safety and so many other good causes,' she wrote.  She also took a shot at his would-be 2020 presidential opponent, adding: 'Donald Trump's foundation was shut down for fraud.'  The Times story Streisand linked to took a critical look at Bloomberg's foundation, which donated an estimated $2.3billion in 2018.  The article drew attention to the fact that Bloomberg began increasing donations to causes outside the East Coast in recent years, suggesting that he may have done so to grow political support ahead of his presidential bid.  Streisand and Bloomberg have known each other for years, having been pictured together at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner in 2013.  The Broadway legend is one of Hollywood's most outspoken Democrats and was an ardent supporter of Hillary Clinton during the last election.  Her tweet backing Bloomberg came just as reports emerged that the candidate is considering Clinton as his running mate should he earn the Democratic nomination.  A spokesperson for Bloomberg's campaign responded to the Clinton speculation by saying he is 'focused on the primary and the debate [on Wednesday in Las Vegas], not VP speculation'. However, the spokesperson did not rule out a possible Bloomberg-Clinton ticket.
