An English man who is now living on the streets in Australia has penned a heartwarming note trying to find a woman who left him food as he slept on a park bench. Phil, who has been sleeping on a park bench at Fawkner Park in Melbourne, woke up one morning this week to find some food in front of him. The woman was already walking away when Phil noticed the food, so he wrote the note in the attempt to track her down and say thank you. 'Hello! My name is Phil. I am English and now homeless in Melbourne,' the letter read. 'I slept on this bench last night at Fawkner Park.' 'A very kind lady left some food for me when I woke up. I think she is a nurse at The Alfred Hospital, she had a blue uniform on as she walked away.' 'I would just like to say thank you to her.' The letter was posted to Reddit and quickly garnered lots of attention, with many of the comments praising the woman for her kind gesture. 'I work in the community housing sector and I know first hand how terrible the journey in and out of homelessness is for so many people,' one user commented. 'It's acts like this which can give hope to a heavily margnised part of our society. We need more of this.' Other users commented on Phil's kindhearted nature and considered trying to find Phil and seeing if he needs anything. 'My husband and I are thinking of looking for him tonight and seeing if he needs anything,' one user wrote. 'I want to give Phil a hug,' another Reddit user commented.
