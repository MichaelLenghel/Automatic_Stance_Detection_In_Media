From Grayson Perry's holiday home to a German Kindergarten shaped like a cat, the outlandish world of Postmodern architecture is celebrated in a new book.  Postmodern Architecture: Less is a Bore, by Owen Hopkins, showcases stunning examples of what has long been considered one of the 20th century's most controversial architectural styles.  Postmodernism began in the 1970s, reached a fever pitch of eclectic non-conformity in the 1980s and 90s, and after nearly 40 years is now enjoying a newfound popularity, causing a sensation on social media.   Here, a selection of the weird and wacky architecture featured in the book, which are sure to delight enthusiasts and eccentrics alike.  Postmodern Architecture: Less is a Bore by Owen Hopkins is published by Phaidon, £29.95 (phaidon.com)
