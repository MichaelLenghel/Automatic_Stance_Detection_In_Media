Feb 11 (Reuters) - James Hardie Industries, the world's biggest fibre cement maker, posted on Wednesday a 17% jump in third-quarter profit, underpinned by a strong performance in its North American housing business. The Ireland-headquartered firm posted an adjusted net operating profit for the quarter ended Dec. 31 of $77.4 million, compared with $65.9 million a year ago. The company expects full year adjusted net operating profit to be between $350 million and $370 million, raising the lower end of the forecast from $340 million.
