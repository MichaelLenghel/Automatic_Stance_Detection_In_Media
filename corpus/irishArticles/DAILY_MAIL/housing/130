Potential home owners looking to get onto the housing ladder could snap up several properties which have a starting price of 'nil' or £1 at auction.    The homes, all of which are in County Durham and Sunderland, have been given a bargain basement reserve price because they are boarded up, in serious need of renovation or only available for external viewings. The properties include two and three-bedroom homes and whilst they may look worse for wear, they could be renovated into something spectacular.    The properties are going under the hammer in Bond Wolfe Auctions' sale on February 27 at the Holte Suite at Aston Villa FC and their prices are likely to shoot up under intense bidding.  The auction houses's chief executive, Gurpreet Bassi, said: 'Each of these properties obviously needs substantial investment, time and effort to return them into decent homes, but for the right investors they could be great bargains.' Buyers will still have to pay an administration fee of just over £1,000 for each home, but that is a small amount compared to an average house price in the UK of £234,000.
