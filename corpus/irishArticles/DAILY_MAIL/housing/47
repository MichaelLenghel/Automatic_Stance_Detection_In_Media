An Asian woman was left a vile racist note criticising the way that she parked her car outside her house. Prue, who wished to withhold her surname, parked her car on the footpath in Queenstown, New Zealand, on Saturday before finding the handwritten letter.   'Stop parking on the footpath. Only an Asian woman would be so stupid. You live in New Zealand. Act like a Kiwi. We have children who use the footpath,' it read.  The 26-year-old was born in China but has been living in New Zealand for four years and had only moved into the housing estate in Frankton a week ago. Prue told Stuff there aren't many car spaces on the dead-end road, meaning there are often cars parked on the grass and the footpath at the end of the street. The racist note shocked Prue, who said whoever wrote it should have approached her in a more mature manner.  'There could be a nicer way to let me know it's not allowed,' she said. 'I thought, "shame on them". They talk about children ... their behaviour isn't a good example for children,' she said.  'They identified me as an Asian woman. They may know where I live. I am afraid they may hit my car. I really don't feel safe now because of this paper.' Prue reported the letter to police and noted that this behaviour is not what she expected when she came to New Zealand. 'When I first came to New Zealand I thought Kiwis were really nice and friendly and smiley. I don't think whoever wrote that note was acting very "Kiwi",' she said.
