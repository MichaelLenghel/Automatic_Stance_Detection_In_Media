A century of youth culture has been revealed in a set of never-before-seen pictures, from keep-fit classes for schoolchildren in 1910 to pre-Millennium raves on the pier. The nostalgic shots show teenage tribes relaxing, dancing and posing in Clacton-on-Sea in Essex, which in its glory days was a bastion of the music scene. In the 1950s, it was one of the first places people could hear imported records, while in the 60s groups like The Kinks played in the town hall and later on the iconic pier nightclub Oscars attracted acts from across the world. One photo shows a 1990s acid house raver lost in the music while surrounded by ponytailed and buzz-cut dancers. The picture was captured at one of the infamous parties held in the seaside town, where top acts like The Prodigy cut their teeth. Leather jacket-clad rockers from 1969 can be seen in another photo which shows 14 likely lads showing off behind their vintage vehicles.   A tamer still from the 1920s shows a group of women lounging by the beach with the iconic pier in the background. The demurely-dressed teenagers are fully clothed in the sepia-tinged shot which is a stark contrast to other pictures taken in the coming decades. The exhibition entitled Grown Up In Clacton: 100 Years Of Youth Culture has been organised by the Museum of Youth Culture and is open to the public until March 5, 2020. More than 400 images dating from the 1910s to the modern period were donated by locals over four months.
