JERUSALEM, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday he was moving forward with a plan to build some 3,500 homes for Jewish settlers on the outskirts of Jerusalem, a project that had been frozen after international criticism. "I have given instructions to immediately publish for deposit the plan to build 3,500 housing units in E-1," Netanyahu said, referring to a preliminary stage of the project. "This had been delayed for six and a half years." (Reporting by Jeffrey Heller)
