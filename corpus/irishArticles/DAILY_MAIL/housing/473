Many young Australians appear to have missed out the chance to own a home with house prices recovering in record time. Sydney's median house price is now on the verge of surpassing the $1million mark for the first time in almost three years. While house prices in Australia's biggest cities plunged in 2017 by a record level, they are set to recover in record time.  An analysis by real estate data group CoreLogic found property prices in Sydney and Melbourne were likely to take just 10 months to rise from the low-point to the previous market peak. Average property market recoveries since the late 1980s have taken 11.7 months. CoreLogic's head of residential research Eliza Owen said Australia's biggest housing markets were likely to 'make a full nominal recovery' by April.  'With record-high values expected across Australian dwellings in a few months' time, 2020 will see the fastest market recovery on record with respect to the length of the downswing,' she said in a blog. 'And it's being led by owner-occupiers.' Since bottoming out in June last year, Sydney's median house price has surged by 14.7 per cent from $866,524 to $994,300 in January 2020. Home values in Australia's biggest city are just $55,440 from their July 2017 peak.  During the past year, Sydney's median house prices has climbed by 9.3 per cent, with the property market still going backwards this time last year. Melbourne's equivalent values have increased by an annual pace of 8 per cent to $798,671.  During that time, Hobart's real estate values for homes with a backyard have climbed by 5.1 per cent to $512,899.  Canberra's median house prices rose by a more modest 4 per cent to $701,561 while Brisbane's mid-point for detached homes edged up by 1.4 per cent to $547,860. Adelaide's property values rose by just 0.3 per cent to $474,273.  Not every capital city market enjoyed price rises during the past year. Perth's median house price has slumped by 5.6 per cent to $456,803 while Darwin's equivalent value has plummeted by an even more dramatic 9.7 per cent to $469,834. Since house prices peaked in Sydney and Melbourne, the Reserve Bank of Australia has cut interest rates to a new record-low of 0.75 per cent.  The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority has also relaxed lending rules around investor and interest-only loans.
