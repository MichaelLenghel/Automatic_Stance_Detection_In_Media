A look at some of the key business events and economic indicators upcoming this week: EYE ON CONSUMERS The Conference Board issues its latest index of consumer confidence on Tuesday. Economists expect this month's index will show a reading of 132.5. That would be the highest reading since August. Continued strength in the job market and low unemployment has helped keep the index elevated. A reading of 90 or better reflects a healthy economy. Consumer confidence, by month: Sept. 126.3 Oct. 126.1 Nov. 126.8 Dec. 128.2 Jan. 131.6 Feb. (est.) 132.5 Source: FactSet HOME SWEET HOME Lower mortgage rates helped boost sales of new homes in 2019 after a weak start to the year.
