Ministers are reviving plans originally drawn up to cope with a No Deal Brexit to help tackle the impact of the coronavirus on businesses. They are concerned that Chinese cities and factories could be locked down for months, creating a shortage of goods that UK firms rely on. Whitehall officials have been ordered to dust off crisis plans made to ensure the flow of vital supplies if Britain left the EU without a deal. It comes after concerns about companies running out of lifesaving equipment or parts for supply chains. The virus has forced businesses with Chinese operations to close factories. Those affected include iPhone maker Apple, car manufacturers Ford, Volkswagen and Nissan, airlines such as British Airways and drug giant Glaxosmithkline. Experts fear the virus’s impact could cost the world economy £217billion in the first quarter of 2020. Chancellor Sajid Javid has reportedly joined meetings of the Cobra emergency committee to discuss the crisis.
