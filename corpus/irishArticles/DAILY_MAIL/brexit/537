What is it? The Impax Environmental Markets trust focuses on the idea the global economy is transitioning from a model where growth is achieved regardless of environmental costs, to a more sustainable one. It invests mainly in listed companies which play a role in alternative energy, water treatment, pollution control and waste technology. What does the manager invest in? The top-ten holdings include US sustainable forestry firm Rayonier and power efficiency business Generac. UK holdings include packaging firm DS Smith and industrial engineer Spirax-Sarco. What do the experts like? Patrick Thomas, investment director at Canaccord Genuity Wealth Management, says it has a 'very long track record of outperformance through being ahead of the curve on disruptive companies'. Any downsides? The portfolio is global, so won't benefit from any rise in sterling if Brexit progresses well, Thomas points out.  He adds that its focus on smaller companies makes its performance volatile, and that its shares are currently trading at a premium to the value of their underlying assets.
