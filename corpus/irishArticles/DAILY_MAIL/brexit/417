John Bercow denied being a 'bully' and a 'coward' after being ambushed in a bookshop by a Brexiteer who posted the confrontation online last night. Samuel Jack accosted the former Speaker, who denies claims that he bullied his former House of Commons staff, in a branch of Waterstones. In the exchange, posted on Twitter, Mr Jack approaches the former politician, before saying: 'You know, you think that you're the victim.  'You think that you're the victim of a conspiracy theory but you're such a coward.  'You're a coward and you're a bully.' Mr Bercow can be heard saying he is not a bully, but as his aide tries to intervene, Mr Jack added: 'Look at that, you're hiding behind your assistant. Like all short men, you are a complete bully.' At this point Mr Bercow responded, saying: 'Oh I see, oh he's bigoted.' Mr Bercow this week raged at a 'conspiracy' to block him from the House of Lords - but insisted he had not given up on becoming a peer. The former Speaker said it was 'blindingly obvious' there was an 'organised effort' to stop him being elevated to the Upper House. The defiant stance came as Labour's Dawn Butler accused Boris Johnson of 'bullying' Mr Bercow - even though he is the one facing claims he abused Parliamentary staff. The frontbencher said she believed the ex-MP was being denied a place in the House of Lords because he had frustrated the PM's Brexit policy.
