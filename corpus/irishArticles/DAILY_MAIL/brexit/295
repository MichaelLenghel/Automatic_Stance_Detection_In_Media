Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has played down reports of a spat between the UK and Australia over leaked conversations British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab had during a recent visit to the federal parliament. Mr Raab met with parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee and the Foreign Affairs Committee during a visit that was aimed at securing closer ties in the UK's post-Brexit era. However, ABC reports the UK High Commissioner has written to the heads of these committees, angered that these conversations were leaked to the media that criticised the UK allowing China's Huawei into its 5G network, something Australia and other countries have blocked due to security reasons. The national broadcaster also says the intelligence committee now won't be travelling to the UK as planned next month. Mr Frydenberg declined to discuss the reported row, saying diplomatic ties between the two countries have never been stronger. "Boris Johnson and Scott Morrison work very effectively together," he told reporters in Melbourne on Saturday. He said Australia and the UK have a strong economic and strategic partnership. "And it's a partnership that will be solidified further with a free trade agreement that we are both working on."
