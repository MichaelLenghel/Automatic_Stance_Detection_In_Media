Sue Radford has shared a picture of her 30 week baby bump, as Britain's biggest family prepare to welcome another child.  Sue, 44, and husband Noel, 48, from Lancashire, who welcomed their first of 21 children thirty years ago, announced the latest pregnancy in a clip posted to YouTube in October. The new arrival, expected in spring 2020, will be a little girl, bringing the family's total up to 11 girls and 11 boys. And this week Sue Radford took to their Instagram account, which boasts 211,000 followers, to share an impressive snap of her blossoming belly. Pulling up her jumper to reveeal her bare bump, she wrote this week: 'Totally forgot to post my 30week bump picture on Wednesday.  'So proud of the fact this belly has grown 22 humans #30weekspregnant #bigbelly #whatsyoursuperpower #growingatinyhuman'. The post racked up over 14,000 likes, with followers sharing their messages of congratulations.  'And no stretch marks, I'm impressed!', one follower wrote, while another added: 'Beautiful bump! I can't tell you carried 22 humans! Love your family! You are very blessed'. Speaking about the new addition Sue recently told The Sun: 'Most people have one of each sex and stop there. It is perfect to have an exact balance of boys to girls so we have 11 to 11'.  She added: 'Now we will all have to agree on a name for her - it will be as difficult as Brexit with all the kids having their own opinions on what names they like.'   The family, who claim £170 in child benefits a week, have to rely on Mr Radford's bakery business to make ends meet and pay for their ten-bedroom house.  All of them apart from Chris and Sophie still live with their parents, with Sophie now having three children of her own.  The most recent child is Bonnie Raye, who was born in November 2018, with the others being Chris, 30, Sophie, 25, Chloe, 23, Jack, 22, Daniel, 20, Luke, 18, Millie, 17, Katie, 16, James, 15, Ellie, 14, Aimee, 13, Josh, 12, Max, 11, Tillie, nine, Oscar, seven, Casper, six, Hallie, four, Phoebe, three, and Archie 22 months.    The couple met for the first time when Sue was seven, before going on to have their first child when Sue was 14 and Noel was 19. They got married in 1993 when Sue turned 18, and went on to have nine children before Noel had a vasectomy - which he later had reversed. Sadly Alfie, the couple's 17th child, was still born on July 6th 2014.
