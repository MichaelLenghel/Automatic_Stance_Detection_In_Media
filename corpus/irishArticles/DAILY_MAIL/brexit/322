English football’s post-Brexit transfer regulations are forcing Premier League clubs to fast-track moves for Europe’s best teenagers this summer. Sportsmail reported on Wednesday how Brexit will affect the way English club academies operate, particularly in terms of recruitment, and it is already taking hold. From January 1 next year, when clubs come under FIFA regulations, not EU law, they will not be allowed to sign overseas players under 18 years old. As a result, clubs are planning to accelerate their interest in a number of the continent’s best young players this summer. Red Bull Salzburg wonderkid Luka Reischl is among the players being monitored by a number of top-flight clubs, including Tottenham and Manchester City. The 16-year-old forward is regarded as one of the most promising youngsters in Europe and is attracting widespread interest. Premier League sides would usually scout a young player for at least a season before deciding whether to pursue their interest, but due to the forthcoming rule change, Spurs and City are among the teams being forced into making a swifter decision on Reischl, who has scored 63 goals in 41 academy appearances in Austria. The post-Brexit transfer regulations mean English clubs interested in the Austria Under-16 international must attempt to sign the teenager during the forthcoming summer window or risk missing out on the striker. English clubs can, of course, return for Reischl, who could be available for as little as £2million when he turns 18, but they realise the striker could be far more expensive to sign by that stage.
