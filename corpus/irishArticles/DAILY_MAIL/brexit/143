A musician was left covered in blood after he was 'beaten up for being Welsh.' Guitarist and singer Rhys Underdown claims he was abused and told to 'leave England' by a 'group of Tories' who then assaulted him.  Mr Underdown, who studied at the University of Oxford, says the alleged assault took place after he and his Indie band, Bandicoot, performed a gig in Bristol. The band have since shared photographs of Mr Underdown's injuries on Twitter.  Accompanying the pictures, they wrote: 'Imagine being beaten up for being Welsh,' before using the hashtag 'Brexit'. Following the post on February 18, Welsh UFC fighter Brett Johns reached out and offered his support. He posted: 'Come and see me my man and I'll do some free self-defence lessons with you. 'Until you're happy and confident. Cymru am byth.' The band described the assault as 'anti-Welsh' before adding: 'The guys were bragging about being Tories and telling us to get out of their country. 'May be a tad unrelated to Brexit but seems a sad reflection of the country's mood.' The post has lead to an outpouring of support from fans, who have called out the alleged attackers.   The band confirmed police had been contacted. Mr Underdown said he was doing 'absolutely fine', adding that there were some 'absolute buggers' around.
