As we approach 75 years to the day since British troops landed on the beaches of Normandy, the world is reflecting on how the 6 June 1944 changed the course of history. But in the UK at the time there was no talk of an allied invasion at all, especially not in the country's daily newspapers. The operation was kept top secret in the months beforehand, with the British desperate to mislead the Germans on the time and location of the landings.  Daily Mail archives for the week 3 to 6 June 1944 reveal how Britons were instead reading about the goings on in Rome, the first European city to be freed from Nazi control, instead. The Normandy landings were absent from the pages of the paper, which hit the shelves every day despite war raging elsewhere, apart from Sunday, which only got its own paper in 1986 when the Mail On Sunday launched.  With rationing still in full swing, the newspaper was just four pages long, but still crammed with practical advice from the RAF on how to peel potatoes, or grow the best tomatoes despite having to cope with rationing. There were also book reviews, crossword puzzles and sporting results - all which would have helped give readers a welcome respite from the war coverage. Here MailOnline takes a look back at how the Daily Mail, perhaps unknowingly, covered the run-up to D-Day from Fleet Street to the front line between Saturday June 3 to Tuesday June 6 1944, when the famous operation that changed the face of the Second World War took place.  Saturday, June 3, 1944: KESSELRING'S 'ROME LINE' SMASHED Monday, June 5, 1944: ROME OURS: GERMANS FLEE NORTH Tuesday 6, 1944: ADVANCE SPEEDING BEYOND TIBER
