Shoppers are praising a $50 serum as their go-to product for bleach-damaged hair, saying it's been a 'game-changer' for their locks. The vegan formula is especially powerful because it's free from silicones and sulfates. On the Sephora website, Olaplex No. 3 is described as 'a concentrated treatment that strengthens the hair from within, reducing breakage and improving its look and feel'. To use the serum, you simply apply a generous amount to towel-dried hair and leave on for a minimum of 10 minutes. According to users, the longer you leave the product on for, the more effective it is - with some even leaving the product on for as long as 90 minutes. Once you've left it, you should rinse, shampoo and style your hair as usual. Reviews online of the product are unanimously positive, with many people saying the $50 product is 'worth every cent'. 'I have super frizzy and stubborn hair. But after using this, my hair was tamed and I don't see any curly strand coming out!,' one woman posted. 'And it leaves my hair shiny and manageable and smells really really good too. Definitely will re-purchase.' Another wrote: 'I love this product and can't say enough good things about it.  'I highly recommend leaving the treatment in overnight, so the product can really soak into the hair. It leaves my hair feeling soft and hydrated.' Before-and-after photos of the serum online also showcase just how much it can do for dyed and bleached hair.  'I've been lightening my hair for over a decade,' one reviewer said.  'While using Olaplex my hair has been the softest with least breakage ever. It's truly a hair saver. I don't need extensions in for thickness now. I use this product weekly and would recommend.'
