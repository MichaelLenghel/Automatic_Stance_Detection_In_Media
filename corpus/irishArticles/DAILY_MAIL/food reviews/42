KFC and Pizza Hut have joined forces to make a cheesy pizza topped with popcorn chicken and sweetcorn on a gravy base.  The creation is available for two weeks only from today until 16th February at Pizza Hut Deliveries across the UK.  The two fast food giants teased fans with the collaboration last year, but it was only on offer for two days.  Taking classic ingredients from both restaurants, the popcorn chicken pizza features a doughy classic crust base, smothered in KFC's gravy and sprinkled with mozzarella and sweetcorn.    It's then topped with pieces of KFC's famous popcorn chicken coated in the secret 11 herbs and spices blend. The pizza is only available as a takeaway option, and the exact price depends on where you order from. It's only available in large size, which is made up of 10 slices, and usually costs around £20, but can cost less when included in deals. Taking to social media, fans couldn't wait to share their excitement at the feasts. Writing on the Food Reviews UK Instagram one person wrote: 'This is pretty exciting'. Another said: 'Our dreams come true' A third added: 'oh em geeeeeeeee  'I know where you'll be going for lunch tomorrow' wrote another, tagging a friend.   While others were more intrigued than excited: 'I’m not sure about it but I would like to try'  Pizza Hut doesn't charge for delivery but restaurants set their own minimum orders, which are usually about £12.99. KFC and Pizza Hut are yet to release how many calories are in a pizza, but a large classic is usually about 1,870 calories and a regular popcorn chicken is 285 calories, meaning the pizza may be more than 2,000 calories.
