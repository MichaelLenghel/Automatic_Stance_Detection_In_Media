With the capability to smoothly apply both liquid and powdered foundations, it's no wonder beauty sponges are widely popular.  And now the $15.99 Beakey five piece makeup sponge set has been deemed one of the best yet with more than 4,000 positive five-star reviews on Amazon. 'The sponges expand nicely once damp, and felt spongier and more dense compared to other sponges,' one reviewer wrote online.  The non-latex product can be used when dry or wet depending on the type of product being applied.  To create a natural look using powder foundations apply using a dry sponge, while for liquid foundations and concealers soak the sponge in water beforehand.  The sponges are designed to absorb the perfect amount of product to avoid wastage and create a 'seamless coverage'.  The product is also made from a non-allergenic material, meaning it can be used on sensitive skin without causing irritation. Less than 10 per cent of users rated the product under three stars as each sponge is soft, expands well when wet and provides flawless coverage. 'Fantastic for the money, a little more dense than branded sponges but work just as well,' one user said. 'They expand huge and they’re very soft - I will definitely repurchase these instead of more expensive ones.' Similarly to other sponges, the item can also be used on different areas of the face.
