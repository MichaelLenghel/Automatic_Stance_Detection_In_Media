Australia coach Matthew Mott has called for DRS reviews to be included in future women's Ashes series, after a controversial decision blighted the first one-day international. England batter Fran Wilson was given lbw when replays clearly showed the ball struck her glove as she was sweeping in front of her stumps. Wilson looked in good touch on 15 off 21 balls and alongside top-scorer Nat Sciver (64) could potentially have put on a match-deciding partnership in a close game where Australia chased down 178 with two wickets to spare. Although the decision favoured Australia on this occasion, Mott said he would much rather the option of removing the possibility of such an error affecting the outcome of such an important match. "I'd love to see it in," Mott said. "I think if you've got the technology there and there's enough cameras then it should come in. "It makes sense for me to have it if we can. I don't know the rationale behind not having it. "I couldn't imagine any of the coaches knocking it back because it's an added resource. "In big matches like this there's plenty at stake." The ICC laws regarding the use of DRS state that "both participating Boards may agree to employ the DRS for an ODI" if the minimum camera requirements are met. Alyssa Healy also lamented the inability to review errant decisions. "It's obviously going to take the howler out of the situation," she said. "There's a couple of us that we could have reviewed as well. "I'd love to see it. Especially being a televised game there's a real opportunity to have it. " The two sides meet again in Leicester on Thursday, before the final ODI in Canterbury on Sunday.
