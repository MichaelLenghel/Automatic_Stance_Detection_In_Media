A Manchester bar has created the ultimate dish for when you can't decide whether to indulge in a chippy takeaway or a pizza one - by combining both.  The Chippy Tea pizza is a 16-inch feast topped with chip shop-style chips, sausages, mushy peas and even curry sauce. Crazy Pedro's bar in Manchester, which also has a branch in Liverpool, is serving up the 2,000 calorie for £16 - or £10 during happy hour. It first launched the pizza last year and planned to make it available on rotation only, but the dish became so popular that fans demanded it be a permanent fixture. The pizza replaces the usual tomato base with mushy peas and features cheese, chips, sausages and a slather of curry sauce.  Marketing manager Nick Coupland, 28, from Salford, said: 'It is pretty much a classic northern dish - fish and chips and curry sauce and mushy peas. 'I think initially the northern credentials were the reason this pizza did well, but after that was just because people tried it. 'Now it is one of our most popular items, it goes down really well. It is comfort food, we are the only place that serves pizza like this until 4am in the morning, and it is just what you want at 3.30am. 'But at first, we did have people come up and say "we're not sure what it is", or asking how the mushy pea base would work as that is pretty unusual.'  Nick said the pizza came about through a desire to try new things and fuse different meals and has plans to launch similarly experimental vegan meals in the near future. He added: 'We put it on the specials to begin with but we got so much commotion on social media, people wanted to bring it back.'
