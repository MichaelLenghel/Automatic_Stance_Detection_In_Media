Awkwafina is taking her status as a star of the silver screen a little too literally. The actress stepped out Monday for the New York City premiere of her new film The Farewell.  Her red carpet look stood out with some silver glittery eye shadow painted on her eyelids. The rapper-turned-actress arrived in a long-sleeve belted black dress with white polka dots. She completed the look with a pair of beige six-inch pointed stilettos. Her hair was worn down, while she went with a fresh-faced beauty look, sans her bold sparkly eye shadow. Following the screening, the event carried out into the streets of New York as a traditional Chinese parade took place, complete with a dancing dragon.  Awkwafina is earning rave reviews for her first leading role in the film by writer/director Lulu Wang. She stars in the A24 film as Billi, a young Asian American woman who returns with her family to China under the guise of a wedding in order to say goodbye to her dying grandmother, while keeping her in the dark about her critical illness. Not only is it her first leading role, but it's also her first dramatic role. Last year was a busy one for Awkwafina who had scene-stealing comedic roles in two major motion pictures. She appeared as street hustling Constance alongside Sandra Bullock, Anne Hathaway and Rihanna in the star-studded female-led reboot Ocean's 8. She also played the hilarious Peik Lin Goh in the big screen adaptation of Crazy Rich Asians, which notably featured a fully Asian cast. The 31-year-old has a full schedule ahead of her, voicing characters in Netflix's Dark Crystal reboot and the live-action The Little Mermaid, as well as her own Comedy Central show with BD Wong.
