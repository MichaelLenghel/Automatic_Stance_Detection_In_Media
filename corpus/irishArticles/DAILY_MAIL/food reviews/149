The Cyber Monday and Black Friday sales may be over, but a number of deals are still rolling on including this huge discount on the Instant Pot electric pressure cooker. The Instant Pot was one of the best-selling items on Amazon in last year's Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales, and its popularity has shown no sign of waning. It has a staggering 29,333 reviews on Amazon with an average rating of 4.6 out of five stars.  And right now you can snap the Instant Pot up for just $49, saving you a very respectable $50.95 (that's 51 per cent off).  The best-selling multi-cooker combines seven appliances in one, so it acts as a pressure cooker, slow cooker, rice cooker, steamer, sauté pan, yogurt maker and warmer.  Plus, it cooks up to 70 per cent faster, is easy to clean, and comes with a number of accessories including a stainless steel steam rack with handles, a rice paddle, a soup spoon, a measuring cup and a condensation collector. With 14 pre-set cooking functions, the Instant Pot is perfect for anyone with a busy schedule and is super easy to use (despite its rather overwhelming control panel).  All the cooking programs, including slow cooking, are fully timer controlled and you can even delay your cooking time for up to 24 hours, so you can make creamy delicious slow cooker porridge overnight. When the Instant Pot has finished the cooking cycle it automatically switches to keep warm for up to ten hours so your food stays at the perfect temperature.  If you want to cook a stew, you just add the ingredients, press a button and let the pot do all the hard work for you.
