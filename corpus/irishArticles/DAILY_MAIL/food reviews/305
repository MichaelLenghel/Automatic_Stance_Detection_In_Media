A $25 sports bra deemed to be one of the most supportive and comfortable on the market has more than 4,000 positive reviews on Amazon and is selling out fast. The Fittin Racerback top is a moisture-wicking product with removable pads that claims to be perfect for all types of physical activity, with loyal customers attesting to its greatness. 'I didn't struggle to put them on or to take them out and they were so soft and comfortable around my chest,' one reviewer said. 'It wasn't too tight but was enough to cover my entire breasts and hold them firmly even when I was running.' Thousands of women commented on the quality of the activewear and how it easily moulded to their figures. 'When I took the bra out of the package it looked tiny so I didn't think it would fit. But it actually fit perfectly,' one woman said.  'The fabric is extremely stretchy, so it can stretch as much as needed. Nowhere does the bra dig into my sides, like so many other bras do. It really is the most comfortable bra I've ever used.' The seamless design comes in four different colours - including a pretty light blue tint - and they are less than half the price of sports bras from other popular designers. Even mothers who are currently nursing where finding them exceptionally easy to workout and breastfeed in between.  One of the only complaints listed was about the pads inside, which for some people were far too visible while they wore the bra. However these can be taken out at any time to circumvent this issue. Others recommended trialling them at a yoga class or something of a similar low-impact nature before running, because they are not specifically made for high impact activity.    The bra is American-owned but ships to Australia on Amazon.
