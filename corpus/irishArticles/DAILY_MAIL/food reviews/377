A teacher has detailed how she was able to live rent-free for a year by house-sitting.  Eleni, 22, from Adelaide, paid $70 to use house-sitting network websites - Happy House Sitters and The House Sitters - to find people who wanted their houses looked after while they were away.  Not only was she able to stay in expensive homes without spending a cent, her other living costs were covered as well. 'I live rent free, bill free, and they [the homeowners] also buy me food,' she told Yahoo. 'One couple will fill up the fridge before I house-sit, and I can have anything I want from there, the pantry and the laundry.' She said she was paid $500 for staying in a beach-front home for two months, and that she receives a 'lot of red wine'. Eleni said there is minimal vetting involved before homeowners ask her to move into their properties. 'You just make a profile, put pictures up of yourself, and then it's up to the owners to ask if they want certain clearances on anything', she said. She said house-sitting arrangements can last anywhere from two weeks to six months.  Eleni said the websites work on rating systems, meaning if you have good reviews you are more likely to be offered further house-sitting opportunities. She said most of her negotiations with home-owners were done over email.  Sign up for house-sharing websites Make the most of minimal vetting Have the homeowners pay for utility bills and groceries Make sure you get good reviews to increase your chances of being able to house-sit again
