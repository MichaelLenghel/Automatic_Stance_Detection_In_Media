Make-up lovers have praised a 99p collection for being just as good as high-end brands that cost up to ten times the price. Posting on their Instagram page, Home Bargains shared the range by Olivia Hale,  which starts at less than a pound. And the cheap collection has been inundated with five star reviews from shoppers online, with many commending the products for being 'great value for money.' 'I've used Mac, benefit, urban decay, Chanel mascaras and none of them are as good as the 99p Olivia Hale one I got from home bargain,' enthused one. While many who have already got their hands on the collection shared their favourites, others expressed their eagerness to test out the range.  One shopper commented: 'Love this.. 99p blusher, highlighter and bronzer.. Unreal…'  Meanwhile, another advised make-up fans from across the UK to try the 'antique rose lip gloss.' The new make-up range includes everything from concealer, bronzer and highlighter to a complete brush set and marble-effect makeup bag. 'Ladies try the eyebrow palette - it's great and stays put', advised another fan, while a further penned: 'Bought the beauty bag in a set, excellent value for money and lovely to boot'. Others have taken to social media sites to express their love of the products, with one even drawing similarities between the Olivia Hale sponge to that of high-end brand Real Techniques. 'FYI there's a make up sponge in home bargains by a brand called "Olivia Hale" that I swear is EXACTLY the same as the real techniques one - but it's only £1.60.' Meanwhile, another who lived further abroad was keen to get her hands on the highly-praised collection and asked: 'Can we get this brand in the US?' And a fourth said: 'Ooh I'd love to try these out.'
