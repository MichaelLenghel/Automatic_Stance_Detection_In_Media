Bruce Springsteen is still going strong almost 50 years after releasing his first album, having dropped his latest, Western Stars, in June.  The 69-year-old can now add director to his résumé with his first feature-length documentary, a concert film of the same. He cut a sharp look in black Thursday as he attended the world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. Springsteen donned a tailored black sports coat over a black dress shirt, with the top two buttons undone. He tucked the shirt into a pair of black distressed jeans, paired with a black leather belt.  The Born In the USA singer completed the look with a pair of black leather cowboy boots, featuring a crimson tip and stars stitched on the sides.  He sported a groomed salt-and-pepper head of hair and a small silver hoop stud earring. The Boss stopped to greet fans on the red carpet before heading into the screening at Roy Thomson Hall. He took to the stage following the screening with his co-director Thom Zimny for an audience Q&A. Zimny donned a tailored navy blue suit over a blue pinstriped dress shirt, unbuttoned at the top. Producer Carolyn Blackwood was also present, wearing a full-black look in a duster over a lace-trimmed tank top with leather leggings and studded boots. The documentary, which hits theaters October 25, has kicked off to rave reviews ahead of its premiere. The Hollywood Reporter calls it 'a gorgeous tone poem that both deepens and personalizes the audio recording, creating a satisfying emotional arc that isn’t as apparent in the collection of 13 fully-orchestrated country-tinged songs released in June.'
