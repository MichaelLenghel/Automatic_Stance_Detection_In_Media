She made her Glastonbury festival debut over the weekend to rave reviews. And on Tuesday, Australian icon Kylie Minogue was still on a high, as she chartered a $36million (AUD) helicopter across England to her next show in Cornwall. The golden girl of pop, 51, looked sensational in a colourful maxi dress as she boarded the gold aircraft in London with a friend.  Kylie couldn't wipe the smile off her face as she walked towards the helicopter, following one of the biggest performances of her career.  She dressed casually in the yellow, gold and black summer dress, with a matching leather handbag and sandals.  'Here we come,' she wrote on Instagram, as the helicopter prepared to land at the Eden Project in Cornwall, the world's largest indoor rainforest.  Kylie headlined the venue's Eden Sessions on Tuesday night, and will take to the stage once more on Wednesday.   Following her performance at Glastonbury on Sunday, Kylie tweeted: 'Words cannot describe what today meant to me.' She added that the performance, where she wore a $90,000 dress before making five outfit changes, will be 'forever in my heart'.  Kylie was first scheduled to make her Glastonbury debut in 2005, but cancelled after being diagnosed with breast cancer. 'I wished things were different, but life is what it is,' she said on stage over the weekend.
