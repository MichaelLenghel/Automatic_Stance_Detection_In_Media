Asda has put the development of new products on the back-burner as its US owner Walmart looks to slash costs and mulls a stock market float. The grocer has told suppliers it is postponing reviews of its ranges, which allow suppliers and firms to analyse what stores sell and launch new products to boost sales. The halt is thought to be cost-cutting ordered by Walmart after a £14billion merger between Asda and rival Sainsbury's was blocked by the Competition and Markets Authority in April. Two Asda suppliers told the Sunday Times it was intended to save on staffing costs in commercial teams. Judith McKenna, the head of Walmart's international operations, has said the firm is seriously considering floating the business after the merger collapse. Asda said product ranges in each area of the business would see some changes this year.
