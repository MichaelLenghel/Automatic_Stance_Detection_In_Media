My Kitchen Rules judge Manu Feildel has revealed he won't be returning to Australia's 'crap' restaurant industry any time soon.  Speaking to The Daily Telegraph, the 45-year-old Frenchman launched a scathing attack the 'dying' food scene Down Under.     'It is crap. Look at it, the rent is going up, as we know staff pays are going up, the drought so the food is going up and there is very little margin,' he said.   He added that he felt the industry was 'dying' and he's better off in television than being a restaurateur.  Manu told the publication: 'It is tough and the public just wants more and more and they don't want to pay more either so it is a very difficult time for the restaurateurs.'  He added: 'Only the big ones are surviving and all the little ones are dying one by one.' The chef has owned three Sydney restaurants: Duck In Duck Out in World Square, which closed in a year; Aperitif in Kings Cross, which closed after less than a year and L’Etoile in Paddington, which lasted six years.  His Melbourne eatery, Le Grand Cirque, which he opened with MasterChef judge George Calombaris, closed after four months and some bad reviews.    Luckily, his star is only rising on television with Manu set to star on Plate of Origin.  The cooking show will see him join forces with former MasterChef judges Gary Mehigan and Matt Preston.  According to Channel Seven, Plate of Origin 'will be on a scale that Australia has never seen before'.   The self-described 'worldwide food fight' will pit teams from diverse cultural backgrounds against each other to ultimately decide which cuisine will reign supreme.
