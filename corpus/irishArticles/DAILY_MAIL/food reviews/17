Feb 13 (Reuters) - Nestle Chief Executive Mark Schneider has made great strides in positioning the world's largest food company for the future with his aggressive deal-making since taking over in January 2017. The 54-year-old German-American has set a vision on selling premium products in fast-growing categories such as pet food and coffee while disposing of businesses in slower-growth areas such as chocolate and processed meat. Schneider promised to replace as much as 10% of Nestle's existing portfolio by the end of 2020 and has conducted more than 50 transactions and reviews since he took the helm. (https://reut.rs/34b1H2z) In October Schneider indicated he would not stop at the 10% target, describing the portfolio review as an "ongoing process". Below is a summary of the top deals under Schneider's tenure: 2020: * January - Nestle expands its medical nutrition portfolio with the acquisition of Zenpep from Allergan. Zenpep is a medication for people who have a pancreas that is unable to provide sufficient enzymes to properly digest fats, proteins and sugars. * February - Nestle's health science arm invests an additional $200 million in Aimmune Therapeutics after the drugmaker won U.S. approval for its peanut allergy therapy. 2019: * May - Sells its skin health unit, maker of the Cetaphil and Proactiv skincare brands, to private equity firm EQT Partners for 10.2 billion Swiss francs ($10.1 billion).
