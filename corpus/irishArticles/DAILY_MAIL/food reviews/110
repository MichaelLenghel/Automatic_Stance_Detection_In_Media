Her latest movie Cats isn't getting the glowing reviews it was aimed to get.  But Rebel Wilson - who plays Jennyanydots in the new musical - appears to be brushing it off after being spotted out enjoying some cool weather in Downtown Aspen, Colorado. The star and her friends were spotted enjoying their time at the St. Regis World Snow Polo Championship event as they mingled in the VIP section. For her day out in the 26 degree weather, the actress bundled up in a silver puffer jacket and a chic turtle neck sweater. The sweater had a navy and white design along the chest and buttons along the collar. She had her vibrant blonde hair curled and threw on a pair of elegant shades. After the event, she was spotted walking around with her friend Mark Hapka, 37. The two appeared to have fun with other friends as they enjoyed life in the VIP tent and watching the polo tournament. This friendly outing comes fresh off the release of her new movie, which currently holds an 18% on Rotten Tomatoes. But while many turned up their nose to the film that also stars Taylor Swift, Jennifer Hudson, Idris Elba, director Tom Hopper recently revealed he didn't even finish the movie until hours before the premiere.  'I finished it at 8 a.m. yesterday after 36 hours in a row. I just put the finishing touches on. So, I'm very happy to be here with it fully finished,' he revealed during an interview with Variety.  'The premiere should be the first time people get to see it, and this is genuinely a premiere.'
