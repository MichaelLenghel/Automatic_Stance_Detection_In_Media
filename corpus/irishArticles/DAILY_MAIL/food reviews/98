Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain are interested in signing Leicester defender Ricardo Pereira. The right-back has earned rave reviews for his performances this season, with Leicester currently second in the Premier League. According to Le 10 Sport, both United and PSG are monitoring Pereira, but Leicester won't sell him in the January transfer window. United signed Aaron Wan-Bissaka from Crystal Palace last summer but are reportedly still on the lookout for another right-back.  Pereira joined Leicester from Porto in 2018 and has made 58 appearances for the Foxes so far.  The Portugal international's current contract at Leicester runs until the summer of 2023.  Having again struggled for consistency this season, United will be determined to improve their squad in January.
