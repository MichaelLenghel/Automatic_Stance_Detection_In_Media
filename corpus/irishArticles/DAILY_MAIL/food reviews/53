A Wiltshire-based Mexican restaurant has been named the best takeaway in the UK at the British Takeaway Awards. Despite a somewhat unprepossessing exterior, Nacho Cheese, in Trowbridge, impressed judges with its menu of nachos, fajitas and quesadillas, with the panel particularly impressed by their commitment to gluten-free and vegan menus. The awards, which is now in its fifth year, recognise the best takeaways in each UK region, alongside crowning the Best Takeaway Chef, Best Takeaway Delivery Driver and the Game Changer delivery restaurant - an award which recognises a business that is pushing the boundaries and driving innovation in the industry.   British Takeaway Award winners are selected by a judging panel, including judges including Ainsley Harriot and Dragons' Den star Sarah Willingham following a rigorous process comprising a public vote, written submission, and mystery shopping. Below, Femail reveals the list of regional winners and four national winners.   NATIONAL WINNERS Best Takeaway in Britain: Nacho Cheese, Trowbridge, Wiltshire Game Changer: Chris' Fish N Chips, Leicester Best Takeaway Chef: Osamu Mizuno, Sugoi JPN, London Best Takeaway Delivery Driver: Mohammed Miah, The Island Restaurant, West Midlands REGIONAL WINNERS Best Takeaway in Central London: Chilli Tuk Tuk, Woodhouse Rd, Finchley Best Takeaway in Greater London: The Brothers Fish Bar, Gravesend Best Takeaway in the South East: S&S Kitchen, Aylesbury Best Takeaway in the South West: Nacho Cheese, Trowbridge Best Takeaway in the East Midlands: Rikshaw, Nottingham Best Takeaway in the West Midlands: Buena Comida, Brierley Hill Best Takeaway in the North West: Brothers Burgers, Saint Helens Best Takeaway in the North East: Casa Rosa, Newcastle Best Takeaway in Yorkshire: Bear Kirchen, Wakefield Best Takeaway in Scotland: Cheeky Moo's, Rutherglen, Glasgow Best Takeaway in Wales: Wiwo, Cathays, Cardiff Best Takeaway in Northern Ireland: Nonna Wood Fired Pizzas, Londonderry    Best Takeaway in Britain: Nacho Cheese, Trowbridge, Wiltshire Also named Best Takeaway in the South West Unassuming from the outside, family-run Nacho Cheese in Trowbridge impressed a panel of judges including Ainsley Harriot and Dragons' Den star Sarah Willingham with their menu of fajitas, quesadillas and burritos.
