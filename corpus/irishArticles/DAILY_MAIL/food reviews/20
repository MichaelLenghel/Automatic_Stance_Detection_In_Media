Travellers searching for the best food, drinks and views Bali has to offer should look to the skies where a glamorous rooftop bar is serving up Asian tapas and custom-made cocktails. Hailed as the 'Best Rooftop Bar' in the 2019 Bali Best Restaurant Bar and Cafe Awards, Above Rooftop Lounge sits atop the Four Points by Sheraton hotel in the upscale resort of Seminyak. An open-air deck offers incredible views of the coast and surrounding landscape, including swanky downtown Seminyak and Petitenget beach, the playground of Bali's rich and famous. Live music is played every evening just before dusk, providing the perfect backdrop to watch the sun go down over the lapping waves of the Indian Ocean. On cooler nights an angled roof lined with exposed bamboo protects revellers from the breeze, with clusters of cushioned couches dotted in every corner. The menu touts a mixture of Indonesian and Asian fusion cuisines, with Sate Babi - Balinese-style pork satay skewers - and kimchi beef salad among the standout savoury options. Indulgent desserts like Pisang Goreng, crispy banana fritters served with ice cream and chocolate sauce, can be enjoyed on the terrace. But the venue is arguably best known for its impressive list of custom-made cocktails, including Pink Martinis and Dragon Lychees.  So popular is the fare, Above Rooftop Lounge also won Readers' Choice at the Exquisite Media Awards in 2019. Diners have been raving about the restaurant in recent weeks online, posting glowing reviews on travel advisory sites like Trip Advisor. Guests from the Philippines described the 'sumptuous' food and 'impeccable' service, while American visitors called Above a 'great place to have drinks watching the sunset'.
