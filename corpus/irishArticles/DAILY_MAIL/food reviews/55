Major League Baseball umpires might wear microphones this season to announce the results of replay reviews, according to multiple reports. The umpires could also use mics to explain rules on the field in a concept that's being actively discussed between MLB and the umpires, according to the reports. It's unclear if the concept, which would follow the NFL and NHL, can be hammered out by opening day, March 26. Arena public address announcers relay decisions in the NBA. The umpires would announce whether a challenged call is confirmed, reversed or stands. One key issue is reportedly ensuring that the mic is turned off in disputes with players and managers. --Field Level Media
