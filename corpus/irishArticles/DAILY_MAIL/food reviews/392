A Masterchef finalist took on a TripAdvisor user who gave his restaurant a one star review because he believed it was a rival trying to sabotage his business. Andrew Kojima, who made the final of the cooking show in 2012, hit back at a customer who slated his Japanese restaurant in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. Koj has been acclaimed by Michelin inspectors, The Good Food Guide, top critics Jay Rayner and Tom Parker Bowles and many more. But the woman diner who left a one star review after a meal at the restaurant in June says it was 'very disappointing on all angles.' Mr Kojima wrote back a lengthy response, responding to claims the waitress was 'uninterested' saying: 'You were being an a**e. She didn't let your s****y attitude affect the way she treated other customers.' Mr Kojima believes he has uncovered evidence that the reviewer works for The Ivy Collection, whose portfolio includes The Ivy Montpellier Brasserie not far from his own eaterie in Cheltenham.  Mr Kojima said the woman made her reservation at his restaurant using a business email which ended in @theivycollection.com. He also believes he has found her profile on the business network LinkedIn. The reviewer has made hundreds of ‘contributions’ to the Tripadvisor site including a number of upmarket eateries in Cheltenham such as The Daffodil, Brasserie Blanc and Wagamama. Mr Kojima believes she was also previously employed by Wagamama.  The reviewer wrote: 'Very disappointing on all angles, food and service. From the moment we went in we were not made to feel welcome and also just left to wait for some time before ordering. She said 'the waitress did not seem interested in making our experience nice at all' and added: 'I was told the food was going to be amazing by a fried [sic] and I had read the reviews so was very much looking forward to it - it could not have been more different. The food was very bland and small portions for the price. 'Large buns bit [sic] very little filling and very dry. The rice dish was luke warm, the aubergine was not cooked all the way through and was tough in parts. The chicken was very bland I was surprised there was not any seasoning with it.' She continued: 'I would usually give a place a second chance but unless we can get the same experience that others seem to have had on reading the reviews I cannot see it worth it.'  In response, Mr Kojima posted a lengthy reply on his own website. He wrote: 'I've written and spoken many times about Tripadvisor. And I'm sure that my thoughts are similar to any chefs you might speak to or follow on Twitter. 'But I never thought I'd have to respond publicly to someone who works in my own industry. 'I don't begrudge a fellow professional an opinion on their experiences in hospitality but surely reviewing your own company's sites on 10 occasions is going too far?  He goes on to respond to a number of her complaints, hitting back at accusations the diner was 'not made to feel welcome' and the waitress was rude. He continued: 'It seems that you'd left by 9.11pm, which as fortunate for both of us.  'You were obviously having a c**p time and it meant you could get over to your old employers at Wagamama to fill up before they closed the kitchen. For us, it meant we might get another table turn in, which you'd know all about having spent time at Wagamama.'  He added about the waitress:  'That is how she is (and all of us are) with most customers. You were being an a**e. She didn't let your s****y attitude affect the way she treated other customers.'  He continued: 'I'm not denying your right to say they're wrong, or that we just got it wrong on the day, but given your experience in hospitality, it seems a little harsh to brand us 'Terrible' in the grand scheme of things.  'According to your LinkedIn profile, you've worked in hospitality for over 15 years. Did you not think those other reviews might be worth something? Did it not occur to you that maybe it's not us, it's you?'  Koj's response has been shared across social media with many people praising it. One user on Twitter said: 'Well said Koj, as always.' Another said: 'Brilliant more restaurants should do this.'  A spokesman for The Ivy Collection said the reviewer does not work for them anymore and was not working for them at the time of booking and when the review was posted.  A spokesperson for The Ivy Collection said: 'We have been made aware of this situation and can confirm the person in question does not work for The Ivy Collection.  'The person does not represent our viewpoint whatsoever. It is not Company policy to review other restaurants as an employee of The Ivy Collection, beyond their personal view in a personal capacity.'
