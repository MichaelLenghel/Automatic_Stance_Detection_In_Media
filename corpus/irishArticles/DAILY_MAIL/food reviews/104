The controversial MCG wicket has received mixed reviews after day one of the Boxing Day Test. After the ball moved around early, leading New Zealand seamer Trent Boult to bowl Australian opener Joe Burns for a golden duck, the hosts went to stumps at 4-257, scoring at an average of 2.85 runs per over. The iconic venue's Test wicket has been criticised for being too flat in recent years, with teams finding it difficult to take 20 wickets. The much-maligned pitch took a huge hit less than three weeks ago when a Sheffield Shield match was abandoned for being too dangerous. Star Australia batsman Steve Smith said it wasn't an easy wicket to bat on, after his half-century on Thursday. "It felt like a difficult wicket, never really felt in all day," Smith said. "It swung all day. "I thought there was probably a patch from the end where Colin (de Grandhomme) bowled...balls were taking off a bit." Smith has developed a love affair with the MCG, going to stumps on Boxing Day unbeaten on 77. He is on track to bring up a century in a fifth consecutive Test at the iconic venue when play resumes on Friday. Boult said once the sun came out, it became hard work for the Black Caps bowlers. "It's turned into definitely a good surface now," he said. "When the cloud burnt off and the bright blue skies came out, it was good, old-fashioned Test cricket and we tried to stay as patient as we could. "I don't want to say never, but I don't think it's going to crack up like it did (in Perth) and open up too much."
