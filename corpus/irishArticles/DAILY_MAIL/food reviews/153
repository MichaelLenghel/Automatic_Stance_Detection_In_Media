A scorned wife claims she caught her husband cheating after a restaurant critic inadvertently photographed him dining with his mistress for a recent review. The anonymous woman made the claim during a weekly question and answer with Tom Sietsema, food critic for the Washington Post.  Around halfway through the session, a post appeared which read: 'Well Tom your latest review is accompanied by a picture of my husband dining with a woman who isn't me!  'Once confronted with photographic evidence, he confessed to having an ongoing affair. Just thought you'd be amused to hear of your part in the drama.  'This Thanksgiving I'm grateful to you for exposing a cheat!' Sietsema, who has been the Post's critic for the last 19 years, replied: 'Please, please, please tell me this is a crank post. I'd hate to learn otherwise.  'I file two reviews a week, for Food and the Magazine, so I'm not sure which restaurant this is.' As yet, nobody has come forward to identify themselves as being involved, and Sietsema did not say whether the woman wrote back confirming whether her original message was a joke or not. Sietsema himself posted an image of the chat on Twitter, writing: 'Cheaters, take heed!' The message quickly went viral, and has since been liked almost 1,500 times and retweeted some 200 times. One user, identifying herself as Sabrina M., wrote: 'I've been sitting in a Lyft less than a mile away from Dulles for 40 minutes now and this has provided me OH SO MUCH entertainment. Just what we need to combat the craziness of holiday travel.' Another, simply named Raoul, wrote: 'At least the papers were served cold.'  Meanwhile Jeff Blattner quipped: 'Looks like one turkey got busted, not basted.'
