An Australian woman has shared how she keeps fruit and vegetables fresh in the fridge for twice as long by using 'food saver' containers from Kmart.  The 1.7 litre multi-functional containers cost just $7 each and have adjustable air vents to maintain airflow and keep food fresher for longer. 'I thought I’d share my findings for keeping things neat and fresh for longer! Kmart have these containers that are just amazing,' the mother wrote on Facebook, adding that she used to shop once a week but now shops once a fortnight.   She said while bananas tend to go brown after a week, they don't ripen as fast when placed inside the containers in the fridge. 'I also put a paper towel between veggies to soak the moisture and it works a treat,' she said.  The containers, which are also BPA-free, freezer safe and come with removal inserts and drainage valves, have been a hit with customers since they launched, with many recommending them on social media.   'This is such a great idea! I might have to go visit my local Kmart,' one user said.  'These are so good for strawberries but I found they warped in the dishwasher – recommend hand washing only,' said another.   In store the product has also already received some positive reviews and has sold out across a few locations.    Not only do the containers help keep your food fresher for longer, they also make your fridge look organised and tidy.  The containers also come in three other sizes and are used for everything from broccoli and cauliflower to berries, leftovers and apples.  Many also pair the containers with labels, which are sold by Kmart for $2 each.
