Burnley are leading the chase for Chelsea midfielder Conor Gallagher, who has been impressing on loan at Charlton Athletic. The 19-year-old midfielder is seen as the next big prospect at Stamford Bridge and his displays in the Championship have been earning him rave reviews. He has scored six goals for the Addicks in 23 appearances for Lee Bowyer's men, and his style of play has been compared to his manager Frank Lampard, with his ability to arrive in the box and provide a goal threat.   And Gallagher's performances have been enough to interest Burnley manager Sean Dyche, who is also keen on Josh Brownhill of Bristol City. Chelsea reportedly have an option to recall Gallagher, who joined Chelsea as an eight-year-old, if they wish to cash in on the star. However, Frank Lampard would be reluctant to sell a youngster with huge potential - especially given his policy to field youth players this season. Meanwhile at Burnley, goalkeeper Joe Hart is likely to shelve a decision on his future until the summer despite MLS interest.
