Boris Johnson and his girlfriend Carrie Symonds have been spotted looking smitten, with friends saying they are still 'very much in love' despite a late-night row that saw the police called in by neighbours. The new and exclusive images of the pair show them hand-in-hand and smiling in the Sussex countryside yesterday afternoon, undermining claims their relationship is in crisis. A friend of the couple told MailOnline claims they are splitting up are smears and revealed the Tory leadership favourite, 55, intends to marry his girlfriend 'as soon as the time is right' after his divorce from second wife Marina goes through. On Friday the couple were spoken to by police after a blazing row and have now been forced to flee their south London home after a gang of anarchists set up camp on their doorstep yelling abuse and slapping 'f*** Boris' stickers on the front door. A confidante told MailOnline: 'There has been so much nonsense touted around about their relationship. The truth is that they love each other very much and want to get married as soon as the time is right. Boris only has eyes for Carrie and she is totally smitten with him.' Hours after the pictures emerged of the couple together for the first time since news of the row broke on Friday, rumours starts circulating in Westminster that the photographs were staged. Members of Boris's leadership bid refused to comment on them, however sources confirmed they were taken yesterday and show the pair in the Sussex countryside. And allies of the former Foreign Secretary denied he was part of any staging of the images. 'Boris definitely didn't arrange for these pictures to be taken,' one source told the Telegraph. Instead, fingers were pointed at Ms Symonds, a PR specialist. 'If they were staged, there is only one other person who it could be,' the source added. Nigel Farage has today criticised Boris Johnson's handling of the revelation that police were called to a domestic incident at his home - saying he is 'astonished' he has not spoken out by now. The Brexit Party leader said it was 'appalling' that the argument was recorded and shared with The Guardian. But he added: 'Is it a matter of public record and public interest? Yes, it is, because the police were called, it's as simple as that. 'I'm actually astonished that he (Boris) didn't say police were called, in my view, maliciously by a neighbour looking to cause problems. I think that actually might have ended the story.' Carrie's close friend Nimco Ali, Britain's best known anti-FGM campaigner, revealed today that the couple are still 'loved up' and Miss Symonds took Boris to a plush Mayfair restaurant to celebrate his 55th birthday last Wednesday. She said: 'They don't deserve this from creepy neighbours. People in love row once in a while. So what, they are human. If anything I think this whole thing has brought them even closer together'. Miss Ali said it's the 'expectation' in their social group that the couple will marry soon because 'they are happy and good for each other', adding in an interview with the Evening Standard: 'Carrie is an amazing woman. Kind, decent and genuinely wants to make the world a better place.' Boris's leadership campaign has been damaged after neighbours called in the Met when Carrie was allegedly heard yelling 'get off me' and 'get out of my flat'. The recording of the 'plate smashing screaming row' was handed to the police and the Guardian newspaper by ardent Remainers Eve Leigh, 34, and Tom Penn, 30, who said that they feared for Miss Symonds' safety.  But Boris and his girlfriend are said to be furious saying it was part of a politically-motivated attack on them by 'hostile' left-wing neighbours who had repeatedly 'crossed many lines', MailOnline can reveal.    Tory MP and Boris supporter Nadine Dorries said today: 'I've spoken to Boris and Carrie over the weekend. They are naturally shocked and upset that their neighbours taped their private conversation for the Guardian. They were aware the neighbours were hostile politically but the campaign against them has crossed many lines.  'They have endured protests outside the flat, aggressive posters, hand-delivered hate mail and provocative behaviour in the street. They have been forced out of their home over fears for safety. But they are very much together, and, if anything, stronger as a result'.  Jacob Rees Mogg has today blasted neighbours who called the police on Boris Johnson and his girlfriend as 'Corbynista curtain twitchers'. The Tory MP also hit out at anarchists who set up camp outside PM hopeful Johnson's South London home after a recording of the couple's late night row was leaked. Mr Rees Mogg branded the protest by anti establishment group Class War as 'absolutely dreadful' forcing the Tory leadership favourite, 55, and partner Carrie Symonds, 31, to flee their home. The ERG chief , who was also targeted by the same anarchist group in September last year, when they barked insults at his children outside his London home, said the events are 'not a good place for politics to be.' He told LBC: 'I think it is absolutely dreadful, I really do. 'I think the idea that snooping neighbours are recording what is going on for political advantage and then class war protesters are coming to politician's front door, which happened to me as well, is not a good place for politics to be. 'I think that politicians should feel safe and unmolested in their own homes. I think that that is a reasonable thing to ask for. I think peaceful protest is absolutely right and part of a free society. 'But the aggression of the hard left is really appalling and not how British politics has normally been carried out, and snoopers are always unattractive'. And ERG chief Jacob Rees-Mogg said the couple who dialled 999 and recorded the row through a wall are 'Corbynista curtain twitchers', adding: 'I think it's absolutely dreadful. I think the idea that snooping neighbours are recording what is going on for political advantage and then Class War protesters are coming to politicians' front doors - which happened to me as well - is not a good place for politics to be.'  Protesters swamped the pavement outside their south-east London flat and the couple are unable to return home - but based on the pictures from yesterday, the couple appear to be going strong.  An onlooker said: 'They looked really relaxed and happy in each other's company. They sat there for ages chatting and holding hands. They didn't seem bothered by anyone or anything else'.   The pictures emerged as some sources claimed that they almost split up at the start of this month - and have had four arguments in just six weeks. According to The Sun, one spat between Boris and Carrie was said to have been caused after he arrived home later than expected.  One friend called the past six weeks 'especially testing'.  The Tory leadership favourite is even said to be 'yearning' for his second wife Marina, who threw him out last September over his philandering, it has also been claimed. Another friend told the Daily Mirror: 'He is yearning for Marina and wistful and would like what he had before. 'But there is no way on earth Marina would sanction any of that. She knows what Boris is feeling and Carrie probably knows what he's feeling, too, which may explain their row'.  Mr Johnson was thrown out by his second wife Marina last September after being accused of cheating on her - and moved in with Miss Symonds, a former Tory aide 23-years his junior.  Debate is raging over whether Carrie and Boris' neighbours had been right to record the row between them in the early hours of Friday morning. The bust-up that has dented his hopes of becoming prime minister, according to two polls over the weekend. A neighbour of Boris Johnson today he had no idea who Boris was and considered sharing a cannabis joint with him while they chatted about UFOs.  Film director Wayne Mosley, 47, said the Tory MP never introduced himself by name and that he only knew him as a neighbour when they had a six-minute conversation about aliens. H e said they got chatting as the politician was entering the south London apartment of his girlfriend Carrie Symonds in the early hours of one night last winter.  Mr Mosley, a self-styled film director known as Yuppie Wayne, said he had lived in the ground floor flat of the house next door for five years. Speaking outside his front door today, Mr Mosley said: 'I'm not interested in politics as I don't see any good coming from it, so I had no idea who he was - I just thought he was the new neighbour.  'He came out and I was smoking weed. He knew I wasn't press, but stood long enough to have a conversation about aliens. We were looking in the sky, there was a blue beam and it was aiming into the sky.  'We looked at each other and I goes, 'do you see that?' and he goes, 'I see that as well'.  'I couldn't explain it, he couldn't explain it, we were looking at each other scratching our heads, but we both knew what we saw. I thought about offering him my spliff, but he was talking about the light He said he saw neighbours Eve Leigh and Tom Penn, who rang the police after hearing noise from Carrie's apartment, drive past the building twice on Sunday afternoon.  Asked what he thought of Tom recording Boris and Carrie's row, he said: 'It was out of order. Everyone has domestics, we all have relationships. 'I believe even the Royal Family have these issues.' He added: 'I don't think that's very neighbourly - not until you really know what was going on in the room.'  Boris faced Tory members on Saturday but refused to discuss the visit by police saying people 'weren't interested' in his private life. His rival for the Tory leadership, Jeremy Hunt, had demanded the Boris comes clean about his late-night clash with his girlfriend. The Foreign Secretary said his leadership rival must explain why police were called. Asked about his rival's silence, Mr Hunt told Sky News: 'Someone who wants to be prime minister should answer questions on everything'.  Boris Johnson today vowed not to 'bottle' leaving the EU in October - despite warnings that least a dozen Tories are willing to torpedo his government if he tried to force No Deal. The would-be PM said the UK had to be out by Halloween 'come what may', urging his colleagues to keep their 'eyes on the prize'. But the scale of the challenge he faces has been underlined by claims that a large group of MPs would join a no-confidence vote to stop the country crashing out without a deal. Defence minister Tobias Ellwood said he believed 'a dozen or so' Tories are ready to take the 'nuclear option' - more than enough to collapse the government.  He told the BBC: 'I think a dozen or so Members of Parliament would, on our side, be voting against supporting of No Deal'.  In contrast other key Brexiteer supporters of Mr Johnson have been urging him to go all-out for No Deal rather than trying to tweak the package Theresa May thrashed out with Brussels.   In his column for the Daily Telegraph today, Mr Johnson attempted to switch attention back to political rather than personal issues. He wrote: 'We must leave the EU on Oct 31 come what may. It will honour the referendum result, it will focus the minds of EU negotiators.' He added: 'It is absolutely vital that we keep our eyes on the prize. It has been a long and parching march - but the oasis is finally in sight. 'We are just over four months away from the date on which, by law, we must leave the EU; and this time we are not going to bottle it. We are not going to fail'.  In an extraordinary full-frontal assault, Mr Hunt also taunted Mr Johnson that he was 'going to lose' the battle for the leadership. The dramatic escalation came as Mr Johnson came under intense pressure to sign up for a Sky News head-to-head debate this week, which has now been cancelled. In a round of broadcast interviews today, Mr Hunt said: 'On the question of debates, he is being a coward. 'It is very disrespectful to say that you're not going to appear in any head-to-head debates in the two weeks when (party members) can see you before they've actually voted. People need to know what you're going to do and you need to answer those questions,' Sky News said Tuesday's planned debate would not go ahead unless Mr Johnson agreed to take part, but offered an alternative date of July 1 in an effort to get both candidates to appear. A spokesman said: 'Sky News has been planning to hold a debate tomorrow between the two remaining candidates in the Conservative leadership election. 'Jeremy Hunt has agreed to take part but Boris Johnson has so far declined the invitation. 'We stand ready to host a debate tomorrow evening if both candidates make themselves available. 'Without both candidates, tomorrow's debate will not take place. 'But we will reissue our invitation for Mr Hunt and Mr Johnson to debate live on Sky News next Monday, July 1.' Today Mr Johnson used his weekly column in the Daily Telegraph to reaffirm his commitment to deliver Brexit by the end of October in an apparent attempt to refocus attention away from his private life. He wrote: 'We must leave the EU on October 31 come what may. It will honour the referendum result, it will focus the minds of EU negotiators. 'We are just over four months away from the date on which, by law, we must leave the EU, and this time we are not going to bottle it. We are not going to fail. 'This time we are not going to shrink in fear from the exit, as we have on the last two occasions.'  With anarchists now camped outside the flat, Boris and Carrie have decided to go into hiding. Friends of the former foreign secretary say it may be impossible for him to return to the £700,000 property in Camberwell, south London. One said the couple had spent the weekend together and their 'loving and doting' relationship was 'stronger than ever'. Mr Johnson, 55, is refusing to break his silence on the domestic incident in the early hours of Friday that saw police officers called.     The pair, who are believed to have started dating in September, shortly after Mr Johnson announced he was splitting from his wife of 25 years, have been living together in Camberwell, south east London. On Friday, the couple got into a heated argument in which Miss Symonds, 31, shouted 'get off me' and 'get out of my flat' and neighbours called the police. Ageing 'anarchist' Ian Bone has been leading the 'class war' protest on Boris and Carrie's doorstep (pictured holding his walking stick yesterday). Mr Bone, 71, a close friend of Jeremy Corbyn's brother Piers, was slammed last year after a sickening tirade at Jacob Rees-Mogg's children  including his six-year-old son - telling them: 'Your daddy is a horrible person'.   And now he's turned up on Boris Johnson's doorstep with six other warriors from the Class War group. Bone was one of the leading lights of the Bash the Rich marches in the 1970s and 1980s and after Prince William's birth was part of a group calling him: 'Another f***ing royal parasite'. He admits to having a working class hatred for the rich as his own father was a butler. His dad worked for Sir Gerald Coke, grandson of the Earl of Leicester, and the family lived in a bonded cottage on a family estate in Hampshire.  Bone's attack on Mr Rees-Mogg in front of his family was not the first time he was caught hissing insults at children. In a video uncovered by MailOnline the Class War protester followed Eton schoolboys calling them 'inbred w******'. The pensioner has been unemployed for decades after completing his degree in his 20s and announcing to his parents that his choice of 'career' was to be an anarchist, and that he would fund it by claiming the dole.  But the altercation isn't the first time they've had an 'explosive' row - with one friend calling the past six weeks 'especially testing'. Another friend told the Mirror: 'He is yearning for Marina and wistful and would like what he had before. 'But there is no way on earth Marina would sanction any of that. She knows what Boris is feeling and Carrie probably knows what he's feeling, too, which may explain their row'. But their body language and behaviour in Sussex yesterday appears to show the opposite.  Leadership rival Jeremy Hunt has raised the pressure on his Tory leadership rival by saying 'someone who wants to be prime minister should answer questions on everything'. As MPs who are backing Mr Johnson also called for him to reveal what happened:  Yesterday, anarchists perched themselves on the steps of Miss Symonds' flat to protest against her lover and his party's policies. Six Class War supporters shouted abuse and held up posters reading 'f*** Boris, f*** the government'. Camberwell residents have also shown their distaste at having Mr Johnson as their neighbour and posters mocking him were put up before Friday's altercation. He stayed out of the spotlight yesterday as his campaign team held talks on how to deal with the crisis. A friend of Mr Johnson and Miss Symonds told the Mail: 'They've spent the weekend together after being driven out of their home in Camberwell and actually the events of the past few days have made them stronger than ever but they really shouldn't have to put up with this nonsense. They're in a very loving and stable relationship. They totally dote on one another.' The domestic dispute was recorded by a neighbour and reported to police.  Neighbours claimed Miss Symonds could be heard screaming and telling Mr Johnson to 'get off me' and 'get out of my flat'. Sources last night claimed that in recent weeks there had been tensions between Miss Symonds and members of Mr Johnson's leadership campaign team. In a sign of the acrimony, one aide who is working for Mr Johnson told friends they believed she had been helping Mr Javid, the Home Secretary, with his failed leadership bid. A MP who is backing Mr Johnson said it was 'probably best' for the couple to decide whether or not to get married. 'A decision needs to be made,' the MP added. A source involved in Mr Johnson's leadership campaign said: 'The bigger worry is that this brings his personal life into play more generally. Things that might previously have been seen as 'not relevant' or 'not in scope' suddenly become fair game. 'Some MPs have been worried about Carrie, but I think she's politically savvy enough to know how to play things without causing damage to Boris.' The street outside Boris Johnson's love nest descended into a circus at the weekend as campaigners swooped in. Simmering discontent among residents at their new neighbour exploded into the open after news broke of Mr Johnson's angry row with his girlfriend Carrie Symonds. Posters were plastered across railings opposite the South London flat mocking the Tory leadership contender, with one urging him to move back to a swankier part of the capital. Anarchists stood on the steps of the building carrying posters and shouting. Seemingly using the incident as an excuse to protest against the Conservative party, one veteran warned the couple would 'regret' moving to the area. Mr Johnson and Miss Symonds, 31, have not been seen at the Grade II listed building since police were called in the early hours of Friday. The couple who recorded the row and shared it with The Guardian newspaper  Eve Leigh and Tom Penn  were also not home yesterday. Miss Leigh has admitted making an offensive gesture at Mr Johnson when they met on the steps of their building last week. But neighbour Wayne Moseley, 47, defended the politician, saying he was a 'cool guy' who would chat on the steps while Mr Moseley smoked cannabis. The film director  who goes by the name Yuppie Wayne  even criticised his neighbours for recording the argument. Describing Mr Penn as a 'peaceful guy', he added: 'I'll be honest with you, neighbour to neighbour, no I don't think it was very fair. 'We all have domestic arguments with our partners.' Describing how he would see Mr Johnson 'all the time', he said 'I've met him on the doorstep, when I'm smoking my marijuana out here. I thought he was a cool guy.' He said Mr Johnson had never said anything regarding him smoking cannabis and that he had never offered him any. He said that Miss Symonds was a 'nice girl, a pretty girl'. Mr Moseley recently sparked a police response after shooting a scene involving two fake guns with a millionaire former Big Brother housemate. He spoke out as six anarchists from the anti-establishment group Class War staged a protest outside the flat. Standing outside the front door behind a banner, veteran anarchist Ian Bone, 71, called on Mr Johnson to come out, shouting 'Looks like Boris is moving out anyway, can't take the pressure'. When asked whether his actions may drive a 31-year-old woman out of her flat, he said: 'I don't think she will come back  they will regret moving here and not Notting Hill or somewhere like that. 'She's not welcome here or any other working class area  and neither is he.' The retired health worker was once arrested for public disorder after protesting outside a previous address of Mr Johnson in North London in 2016. Another protester, who gave her name as Sorcha, has lived in the area nearly thirty years and said: 'Refugees and migrants are welcome, Boris isn't.' Residents along the leafy street have also shown their distaste at having Mr Johnson as a neighbour. Kirstie Lamont, 48, said: 'This area is just not hostile. We probably wouldn't throw yoghurt on him if he walked by. But we wouldn't be inviting him around for dinner.' When asked if the posters could make Miss Symonds feel unwelcome, she said: 'Well, move. Sorry, that does sound very aggressive. Kensington and Chelsea, that's more the area that he belongs.' Another local resident  who was attending a dog show on the green opposite  said: 'This is a pretty gentrified area, we're all liberal here, so he doesn't really fit in. I understand he's just going to his girlfriend's house, but the posters show he's not exactly welcome.' There comes a moment in every fledgling relationship  however promising  when the hot-cheeked joy starts to fade. Pet names such as Bozzie Bear and Otter begin to lose their charm. Peccadilloes  messiness, high passion, vaulting ambition and a disregard for money  once so endearing, suddenly start to become annoying. And the challenges of co-habitation, of trying to blend two very different lives into one, begin to hit home. And just perhaps  if you're used to living in a five-storey £3.75million family home in Islington and hoping to be become prime minister in the next few weeks  you might ask yourself why you're cooped up in a two-bedroom flat in Camberwell with a girlfriend 24 years your junior who's keen on yoga, healthy eating and protecting the environment. If their recent humdinger of a row is anything to go by, Boris Johnson and 31-year-old Carrie Symonds seem to be past the honeymoon period. Well past it given Carrie's cries of 'get off me... get out of my flat!' unhelpfully recorded by a neighbour in the early hours of Friday. The row sounded nasty. Friends have been quick to deny they are on the verge of breaking up. Yet there are certainly signs that the carefully curated all-new, slim-fit, low-alcohol prime ministerial Boris is feeling the strain. Last week, photographs of the inside of Boris's Toyota provided a study of utter chaos  empty food cartons, water bottles, crumpled clothes, plastic bags, children's books, crumbs and receipts. On Wednesday, he was spotted in a Tesco Express in Islington, close to his former marital home. Rucksack on back, crumpled as ever, he was in a hurry and, according to a witness, looking 'certainly not statesmanlike' as he rushed in to browse the two-for-one wine offers. Two days later, he turned up at the Conservative hustings in Birmingham with one brightly patterned sock inside out and uncomfortably bunched, displaying a big chunk of pink ankle. Perhaps all this is a result of the pressure he and Carrie have been under. They've been receiving hate mail for weeks now and the entire vicinity of her flat is plastered with anti-Boris posters. They're even stuck to his Toyota's windscreen  nestling amongst the unpaid parking tickets. Such a public meltdown must be excruciating for Carrie, a PR professional, who has spent months letting it be known via 'friends' how in love the couple are. On top of all this, it's said that tensions have been growing between Boris and Conservative election guru Lynton Crosby over the fact that Carrie is becoming too involved in his campaign. Political insiders say she is keen to adopt a serious role behind the scenes, and is just as keen on No 10 as he is. There are growing concerns that her ambitions may be complicating his campaign. These are trials the couple have tried to face head-on, and together. More difficult to weather together has been the fact that Boris is reportedly 'devastated' that his four older children, furious at his latest relationship, have ostracised both him and Carrie and have refused to even meet his girlfriend. In April his eldest daughter, Lara Lettice Johnson-Wheeler, a journalist just five years younger than Carrie, wrote on Instagram that the past 12 months had been the 'hardest and most hurtful year of my life'. Last year, after details emerged that he had cheated on wife Marina Wheeler with Carrie, Lara reportedly told friends at a party that her father was a 'selfish b*****d'. There have been persistent rumours that Boris, despite his well-documented infatuation with Carrie, privately regrets the end of his marriage to Marina  his extraordinarily long-suffering second wife, and mother to those four older children. She is the woman who stuck by him despite his rackety private life and seemingly endless affairs, and provided him with the domestic stability he so craved after a childhood stained by his father's relentless infidelities and his mother Charlotte's breakdown. Some sources close to the Johnson family say the breakdown of his 25-year union has left him so deeply disturbed that he is 'all over the place' and 'psychologically unfit' to be in another long-term relationship, let alone be prime minister. According to one friend of the couple, quoted in the Mail on Sunday: 'Boris is like a broken reed. The joy just seems to have gone out of him. He can't bear to live alone. He gets totally depressed if he's on his own.' Marina was happy to let Boris shine, to let him be 'front of house' as she busied herself in the shadows, paying the bills, sorting out the mortgage, raising their children, all while working full-time as a very successful barrister. She was calm while he was explosive. Carrie, of course, is not like Marina. As well as being dramatically younger, she is also volatile. Like Boris, she also enjoys being 'front of house' and is used to getting her own way. According to her former boyfriend of three years Oliver Haiste, interviewed in yesterday's Mail on Sunday, life with Carrie involved 'an electrifying dose of dramatic and often fiery conflict'. He added: 'When times were good with Carrie they were great  they were fantastic. When times were bad they were awful' 'She can go in completely the opposite direction and possibly, in my view, to excess.' But Carrie is also beautiful, driven, feisty, waspishly gossipy, ambitious and charming. It is easy to see how Boris fell for her. And he has, according to friends, done everything in his power to make it work. He took her on romantic breaks to Greece and the Amalfi coast, agreed to a divorce from Marina and threw a grenade into his relationship with his children. At her encouragement he lost weight, cut down on booze and meat and got a decent haircut. He's even taken up yoga, for goodness sake! With largely positive results, she has also encouraged him to champion environmental issues, embrace feminist campaigns and distance himself from the unreconstructed Boris of old, who referred to women as 'fillies' and joked about how voting Tory would 'increase the size of your girlfriend's breasts'. For months, they glowed. They weren't troubled by the age difference, the endless bitter fallout that comes from an illicit affair, or their very different backgrounds. Carrie, herself the product of an extra-marital liaison, was born in London in 1988. She excelled at pretty much everything at the £20,000-a-year Godolphin and Latymer School in Hammersmith, west London, and later went to Warwick, where she gained a first-class honours degree in theatre studies and history of art. But politics was always her passion. She joined Conservative HQ fresh from university, became a Tory press officer in 2009 and was soon cutting a swathe through the competition. She worked on the successful 'Back Boris' campaign to re-elect Johnson as London mayor in 2012 and, following the 2015 general election, was appointed a special adviser to the then culture secretary John Whittingdale. In the wake of the 2017 election, she was appointed as the Tories' communications director, and named the UK's second most powerful public relations professional by PR Week magazine. Many friends consider she had found her perfect match in Boris and was, as their row shows, sufficiently feisty to stand up to his legendary temper. A temper which Sonia Purnell, author of Just Boris: A Tale of Blond Ambition, describes as the fiercest and most uncontrollable she has ever seen. 'His normally jokey demeanour flashes into a sarcastic snarl, his skin reddens and blotches,' she said. 'His eyes dart into an intense narrow glare and on the worse occasions his lips curl back to reveal wisps of spittle.' Judging from what we know of their recent row, it was Carrie doing most of the shouting. Of course it was. After all, how attractive is a 55-year-old man, old enough to be your father, spilling wine on your sofa and not giving a fig? 'You just don't care for anything because you're spoilt,' she yelled. 'You have no care for money or anything!' Boris has always had a casual disregard for other people's cash, and considered tedious financial matters beneath him. Which explains the parking tickets all over his car. But he is not the only one looking rather pained. Lately Carrie seems to have lost her glow, too. At the press conference to launch his leadership bid, she seemed anxious and, by her standards, rather downbeat in her long Karen Millen print dress. Perhaps, with the political circus surrounding her, she was beginning to fully realise what a challenge she had taken on in Boris.  Jeremy Hunt today demanded that Boris Johnson stop being a 'coward' - as the front runner dodged another TV debate in the wake of his bust-up with his girlfriend. The Foreign Secretary said Mr Johnson was 'disrespecting' party members by refusing to face scrutiny. In an extraordinary full-frontal assault, Mr Hunt also taunted Mr Johnson that he was 'going to lose' the battle for the leadership.  The dramatic escalation came as Mr Johnson came under intense pressure to sign up for a Sky New head-to-head debate this week. He has been accused of hiding in his bunker by avoiding the face-off, as well as shunning interviews and limiting questions from journalists. Mr Johnson has agreed to an ITV debate on July 9, but some activists will already have voted by then. At hustings over the weekend, Mr Johnson flatly refused to address the explosive row with his girlfriend Carrie Symonds at their south London flat. Neighbours called the police, who took no action, before handing the recording to the Guardian. In a round of broadcast interviews today, Mr Hunt said: 'On the question of debates, he is being a coward. 'It is very disrespectful to say that you're not going to appear in any head-to-head debates in the two weeks when (party members) can see you before they've actually voted.' 'People need to know what you're going to do and you need to answer those questions,'  Mr Johnson remained tight-lipped about the spat with Miss Symonds when he was grilled at a hustings for party members in Birmingham over the weekend. But MailOnline today obtained exclusive images of the couple hand-in-hand and smiling in the Sussex countryside yesterday afternoon, undermining claims their relationship is in crisis.  A friend dismissed claims they were splitting up as smears and revealed the Tory leadership favourite, 55, intends to marry his girlfriend 'as soon as the time is right' after his divorce from second wife Marina goes through.   Mr Hunt, who has insisted Mr Johnson should answer questions on 'everything', said today that his opponent was trying to 'slink through the back door' of No 10 and avoid public debate.  'One of the strengths of our system is that we scrutinise our politicians with more intelligent ferocity than anywhere else in the world. But in this case it just isn't happening,' he said in an article for The Times. 'Nothing could be worse for a new prime minister in these challenging times than to come to power with a fake contest.  'I am not interested in debating Boris's private life. But I do want to quiz him on how he can 'guarantee' we will leave the EU on October 31 if Parliament votes to stop a No Deal Brexit, as it did in March. 'I want to know what he really means by 'reviewing' HS2 or his 'grave reservations' about the third runway  surely he has had long enough to decide what he thinks? 'Don't be a coward Boris, man up and show the nation you can cope with the intense scrutiny the most difficult job in the country will involve.' Nicola Sturgeon has gloated that Boris Johnson will be a 'disaster' for the Tories - as a poll found Scots could vote for independence. The SNP leader delivered a withering assessment of the would-be PM, saying he would 'damage the UK's reputation'. The attack came after a Panelbase poll found Mr Johnson taking charge at Downing Street could put the union at risk. A narrow majority of 51 per cent would currently vote no to independence, according to the research. But when people were asked for their intentions if Mr Johnson becomes premier, the proportion against would drop to 47 per cent.  Speaking on Sky News' Sophy Ridge, Ms Sturgeon said: 'He will be devastating, disastrous for the Conservatives UK-wide.'  She said: 'Brexit has damaged the UK's international reputation but close behind that, Boris Johnson's tenure has damaged the UK's reputation... 'I find it quite hard to get my head around that knowing everything they know about him, they are contemplating putting him in No10.'  Dr Fox told the BBC yesterday: 'I think it is always easier to just give an explanation. It is inevitable there is a focus on private lives. That does not concern me. What I am concerned about are the issues.' Tory grandee Sir Malcolm Rifkind said: 'If you are a candidate to be prime minister and the police have been called to your house  fairly or unfairly  the fact is there was a police visit. You don't just say 'no comment'. 'That implies you may have something you don't want to disclose. It was a lack of judgment to refuse to even make a short comment. 'All he could have said, quite reasonably, would have been that in all relationships there are occasionally outbursts of anger and disagreement.' He rejected the idea that Mr Johnson should be allowed to draw a distinction between his private and public life. But Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss, who is backing Mr Johnson, yesterday insisted the altercation was not of public interest.  She said: 'I believe it's a private matter. I don't think the public are concerned about that. I think Boris is somebody who for eight years as mayor of London did a brilliant job, he served as foreign secretary, people know what he's like in office, and that's what's important.' She warned against complacency as she suggested it was not certain that Mr Johnson would become the next Tory leader  and prime minister. 'It's always dangerous to be complacent and believe that things are inevitable,' she said. Miss Truss also said Mr Johnson would call the bluff of rebel Tory MPs threatening to bring down the Government if he pushed through a No Deal Brexit, adding: 'My view is that Boris Johnson is somebody who is capable of commanding the support of the country and the support of the parliamentary party and I don't believe my colleagues would vote no confidence and risk a Jeremy Corbyn government. 'We need a leader with the determination to follow through, go through to the 31st October, leave preferably with a deal, but without a deal if necessary  and I do not believe in those circumstances those Conservative colleagues would seek to bring a Conservative government down and let in Jeremy Corbyn and his Marxist agenda.' But Mr Fox warned that Mr Johnson's claim that World Trade Organisation rules could be used to avoid tariffs under No Deal was false. He rejected the suggestion that the UK could secure a ten-year standstill in current arrangements if it left without a deal. He also said Mr Johnson's argument that under No Deal the country could use a transition period to negotiate a free-trade agreement 'doesn't actually hold'. 'If you don't get the withdrawal agreement through Parliament, there is no implementation period during which we can do anything at all,' Mr Fox told the BBC. Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds reportedly almost split up at the start of this month - and have had four arguments in just six weeks. But friends of the the Tory leadership favourite claim the couple are 'fine' and have urged Mr Johnson to 'shut down' rumours they could break up.   One spat between Boris and Carrie was said to have been caused after the potential prime minister, 55, arrived home later than expected. Another friend of the politician has claimed he has been 'yearning' for his ex-wife Marina who threw him out over his philandering last year.  Mr Johnson and Miss Symonds have been living together in Camberwell, south east London, after they started dating last September following Boris' split from his wife of 25 years.   On Friday, the couple got into a heated argument in which Miss Symonds, 31, shouted 'get off me' and 'get out of my flat' and neighbours called the police.  Mr Johnson's refusal to put rumours to bed has drawn criticism from his allies, with one Tory MP and friend telling the Sun: 'Boris and Carrie are fine. He should close it down by saying, 'Rows happen but we are all OK'. But he won't, of course.'  The altercation isn't the first time they've had an 'explosive' row - with one friend calling the past six weeks 'especially testing'. Another friend told the Mirror: 'He is yearning for Marina and wistful and would like what he had before. 'But there is no way on earth Marina would sanction any of that. She knows what Boris is feeling and Carrie probably knows what he's feeling, too, which may explain their row'. A friend also told the Sun: 'They've had a series of corrosive arguments, with things obviously coming to a head on Thursday. But they very nearly split up at the start of the month.' Class war anarchists descend on Boris and Carrie's flat as it emerges she's 'too afraid to return' after anti-Brexit neighbours called police on them and handed row recording to newspaper  By Bridie Pearson-Jones and Isabella Nikolic for the MailOnline Anarchists staged a protest today outside the flat of Boris Johnson's girlfriend Carrie Symonds after the 31-year-old said she is 'too scared to return home' following the furore that erupted over her row with him. The protesters were from Class War and included Ian Bone, 71, who was once described as 'the most dangerous man in Britain' and recently faced criticism after accosting Jacob Rees-Mogg's children. It comes after a recording of the couple having a 'plate smashing screaming row' was handed to the police and the Guardian newspaper by their ardent Remainer neighbours Eve Leigh, 34,  and Tom Penn, 30. The group from Class War arrived at the apartment and held up signs that read 'F**k Boris. F**k the government'.    Ms Symonds described the recordings, which hear her telling the Tory frontrunner, 55, 'get off me' and 'get out of my flat', as a as a 'political stitch-up'.  Members of the anti-establishment group - including veteran protester Bone turned up outside the Grade II Listed building just before 2pm today. Bone who walks with a stick, garnered media attention last year when he told Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg's young children 'your daddy's a horrible person'. Two people stood on the steps outside Ms Symonds's £750,000 Camberwell flat holding up a banner that read: 'We must devastate the avenues where the wealthy live.' The banner was emblazoned with the logo of anarchist group Class War - an organisation that originally started as a paper in 1982 but expanded into a political movement.  Quoting radical socialist Lucy Parsons, the poster seemed designed to intimidate - featuring a large skull and crossbones and two anarchy symbols.    One of the Class War mob - holding a sign that read 'Camberwell welcomes migrants not Boris' - said she would be happy for the Tory leadership candidate to 'leave the planet'. 'I want Boris out of Camberwell' she said. 'We don't need old middle class white men telling us what to do. 'Go back to Eton or Highgate or wherever it is white middle class men come from. 'I'm not asking for segregation, I'm asking Boris to f*** off out of Camberwell.' She added: 'People who preach hate speech are not welcome in our community. 'The policies he's going to put in are racist policies. 'I'm not angry with Boris for what he's says, I'm angry at Boris because he exists: the fact that the likes of him tell us what to do and how to do it.' Leader of the group Bone added: 'No more old Etonians, no more feudal aristocracy. 'Come on out Boris! We know you're hiding under your f***ing chaise lounge. 'We've had enough of old Etonians, f*** off!' He added: 'Boris, when you look out of your window we'll be there. 'When you look down the street, we'll be there.' A Boris Johnson government could be toppled on his very first day in Downing Street, senior Tory figures have warned. If the former London Mayor wins the leadership contest, No 10 expects Jeremy Corbyn to call an immediate no-confidence vote in the Commons in an effort to bring down his embryonic administration. Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis and members of the backbench 1922 Committee are understood to have expressed the fear that Mr Johnson would lose the vote, given that the party has a working majority of just four MPs and remains hopelessly split over Brexit. If a new government, either Tory or Labour, cannot subsequently be formed within 14 days, then a General Election would be triggered. No 10 has warned party whips that the no-confidence vote could be called as soon as Theresa May leaves office, which is expected to be on July 24. But the party's factions show no signs of coming together if Mr Johnson takes over. Coming down from the steps outside the flat, and repeating his disregard for so-called toffs Bone continued: 'We've had enough of old Etonians running the country. 'They're all a cabinet of old Etonians. Why we put up with it I don't know. 'On the day Boris is declared Prime Minister there'll be a blockade at Downing Street to stop him getting in or round to see the Queen..'    Asked if Johnson is fit to be Prime Minister, Bone said: 'He certainly ain't - he ain't even fit to be a Pie Minister.'  The protesters moved on after about 20 minutes. Class War tweeted a picture of Ms Symonds's front door plastered in 'F*** Boris' stickers the day before her row with Johnson. Alongside the picture they wrote: 'Oh dear, someone's stuck CW stickers all over Boris' front door!'   Johnson and Ms Symonds have not been seen at the flat since police were called there in the early hours of Friday.  In September last year Bone faced criticism for accosting Jacob Rees-Mogg's children. He told them: 'Your daddy's a horrible person.  'A lot of people don't like your daddy, you know that. No he's probably not told you about that.' The father-of-five added: 'A lot of people hate him.' Bone refused to apologise or answer whether he would have felt he had been hassled by someone if they had done the same thing to him when his children were young.       Local Kirstie Lamont, stood outside Miss Symonds's flat yesterday holding up the posters that have been plastered around Camberwell Green. One was even placed on Johnson's car, next to two parking tickets.   The posters, emblazoned with stars from the EU flag and a picture of Johnson's face, read: 'We'd rather endure him as our neighbour than our Prime Minister'.  Speaking yesterday Ms Lamont said: 'Labour could all be dead and we'd still vote for them.' When asked whether she thought the posters would make Ms Symonds feel uncomfortable living in her flat Ms Lamont said: 'Well, move. Kensington and Chelsea is much more their kind of place.'    Remain-backing playwrights Eve Leigh and Tom Penn do not look out of place in trendy Camberwell, but last night they were branded 'neighbours from hell' by a Johnson-supporting Tory MP. After the pair admitted their role in briefing The Guardian about Carrie Symonds' and Boris Johnson's nocturnal activities, allies and friends of Mr Johnson and Miss Symonds pointed to their neighbours' anti-Brexit sentiment and 'hatred' of the Tory Party. Ms Leigh is the daughter of multi-millionaire musical theatre producer Mitch Leigh. A successful writer, she was the star of a theatre project called Brexit Stage Left, which received financial backing from Eurodram, a cultural campaign funded with Brussels cash. Eurodram's website reveals it is 'co-funded by the Creative European Programme of the European Union'. The event in January described itself as a 'festival of staged readings of provocative cutting-edge plays from across the EU'. The former palm-reader bought her luxurious flat above Carrie Symonds' apartment for £720,000 in April last year. In March this year, she married her partner Tom. Last night he confirmed that he had backed Remain in the EU referendum, but insisted that had nothing to do with the weekend's events. Ms Leigh was described by one interviewer as an 'American Leftist Buddhist Jewish playwright.' Her religious outlook influenced the theme of her most recent play, The Trick, which tackles the topics of ageing and coping with grief. However, it received mixed reviews from critics. The Evening Standard called it 'a mystifying muddle' and said 'it's all increasingly wearisome'. The Guardian gave it two stars and said it was 'overbearing in its manipulative attempts to make us feel sad'. Other work by the playwright includes 'a documentary audio piece about childhood, told through the prism of a Bulgarian borstal'. Mr Penn has yet to match his wife's levels of fame or critical attention in the theatre world.
