They won rave reviews for their halftime show at the Super Bowl on Sunday, but not everyone was a fan of Jennifer Lopez and Shakira's performance. Today's sports presenter Alex Cullen slammed the singers, declaring their high-energy performance as 'too much'. Discussing the Super Bowl during Tuesday's episode of Today, the 39-year-old claimed they showed 'too much skin'. His conservative assessment simultaneously shocked and amused the rest of the show's panel, including hosts Karl Stefanovic and Allison Langdon, and news presenter Tracy Vo, 36. 'You don't like, um, that kind of thing,' Karl, 45, quipped, struggling to maintain his composure. 'It wasn't... It wasn't for the music, let's just say that much,' stammered Alex in response. He explained: 'It was too much. It was too much skin. I thought it was a bit over-the-top.' His remark prompted the show's women to both scream, 'Too much skin!' in disbelief, with Allison, 40, branding Alex an 'old man'. But Karl tried to ease the tension, sarcastically claiming he agreed with Alex's assessment of the halftime show. 'I thought it was disgusting, all that skin. Not my cup of tea,' he joked, eliciting laughter from the show's panel. But Alex stood firm in his convictions, and claimed the racy performance made them bad role models.   'I just thought it was too much. It's sending out a bad message to the young kids,' he concluded.
