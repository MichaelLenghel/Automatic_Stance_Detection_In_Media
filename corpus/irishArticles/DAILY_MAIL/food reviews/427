She's earning rave reviews for her starring role in family drama The Farewell. And on Tuesday, Awkwafina showed her style has reached leading lady levels when she was spotted in two different outfits on her way in and out of the Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Awkwafina, 30, cut a trendy figure on her way into the studio in a cropped denim jacket in a washed black color, keeping comfortable on the bottom in a pair of ankle-length pants by Adidas. She opted for a pair of running shoes as she stepped in to tape the episode. As she was seen leaving after the episode was taped, she opted for elegant volume in a billowy striped blouse with green stripes a large pussy-bow.  Her high-waist, ankle length forest-green bottoms were set off with a pop of color from her pointed-toe, neon-green heels.  Though she's known for an outspoken sense of humor, Awkafina's climb to the top hasn't been met without adversity.  The appearance comes as the actress shared more about her personal struggles with anxiety with Teen Vogue.   'When I was young, I often had difficulty believing in myself and feeling confident in certain things,' she told the outlet.  'I think that I had to really find it. I remember feeling that always, as a young kid.'   As the comedienne saw her fame increase, sloughing negative social media comments became a part of the norm - increasing her symptoms.  'What's toxic stays toxic, and when you bring that toxicity into your environment, it not only affects you, it affects everyone around you,' she explained. 'Instead of using social media to tear people down, use social media to tell your favorite musician how much you love them, or watch a good movie and share about how good that movie was.' The Farewell is currently in theaters nationwide.
