Fascinating colour pictures from the late 19th century capture the beauty of the people and places in the Holy Land. Stunning photos, taken around 1890, show a bustling bazaar in the heart of Jerusalem, a charming cityscape of Bethlehem, and two Bedouin women happily carrying their young children on their shoulders.  The colour postcards, from the Library of Congress collection, were produced using a method called photochrom.  This is a method of making colourised photographs from black and white negatives via the direct photographic transfer of a negative onto lithographic printing plates.  It was invented in the 1880s and was most popular in the 1890s, when these images were taken. Although true colour photography had been developed by then it was not commercially practical yet.  Pilgrims have flocked to the Holy Land for thousands of years as have conquerors, fighting countless battles over the sacred land. The area made its name as the cradle of world religion, being the place where Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad walked and set down the foundations for belief systems adopted by well over half of the world's population.
