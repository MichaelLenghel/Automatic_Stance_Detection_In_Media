He is a devout Catholic. And Mark Wahlberg proudly displayed his faith while was spotted wearing a glittering cross when he stepped out with a male pal in Beverly Hills on Friday. The 48-year-old beefcake encased his toned-up torso in an attractive pink tee, showing off his musclebound legs in grey shorts. He accessorized with a watch and a stylish pair of sunglasses, wearing his hair in a perfect coif and modeling some colorful retro-inspired Nike sneakers. The Boston-born heartthrob discussed the depth of his religious convictions in an interview with Parade magazine years ago. He referred to his Catholicism as 'the most important part of my life. I don’t try to push it on anybody and I don’t try to hide it.' Speaking to Relevant magazine last year, he shared the effect that his Christianity has had on his professional life in show business. 'I think I’m allowed to go and do exactly what I want and how I want to do it with my personal life and my spiritual life, as long as I show up on time and do a great job.' Explaining that he prays for 15 minutes each morning, he dished: 'There are so many things that I think about that I pray about.' Mark elaborated: 'Those that are less fortunate, those that don’t have God in their life and then all the responsibilities that I have as a husband, as a father. 'There are a lot of things that I need help and guidance on. I can lock in on what’s important and what I need to focus on and then, especially, express my gratitude.' The bombshell married Rhea Durham in 2009 and they share four children - Ella Rae, 15, Michael, 13, Brendan, 10 and Grace Margaret, nine.
