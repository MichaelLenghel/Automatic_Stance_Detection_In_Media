Lisa Wilkinson grilled the boss of a Christian lobby group which is backing Israel Folau's controversial GoFundMe campaign to cover his legal fees.   Australian Christian Lobby managing director Martyn Iles, 30, was questioned by Wilkinson, 59, after he said Christians were 'marginalised' on The Project on Sunday evening.  Mr Iles' organisation is backing Folau's massive crowdfunding campaign which has already raised more than $740,000. 'Speaking of feeling marginalised, do you believe that homosexuals go to hell?' Wilkinson asked.  'The mainstream Christian belief on this is that all of us are born going to hell,' Mr Iles hit back.    Mr Iles said many Australians were offended by beliefs that are at 'the heart, soul and core of Christianity'.  'I don't think it's helpful to say that Israel Folau's post targeted homosexuals - it didn't,' Mr Iles said.  'I was on the list. I think each of us were on the list. We're all sinners.   'We'll be judged on our sexual behaviours. Me as a straight man will be judged on my sexual behaviours and found wanting.'    Co-host Tommy Little, 34, found Mr Ile's answer wanting and asked again. 'I'm not really clear what you do think. Do you think homosexuals go to hell or not?' he asked.      'No, I don't think it's that simple,' Mr Iles responded.   'I think that all of us will be judged by God and the reason we go to hell is because we decline the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.'  Israel Folau's GoFundMe campaign to cover his legal costs has so far raised more than $740,000 of its $3million goal.  The fallen rugby star was slammed for raising money after it was revealed he had a $6.5million property portfolio on Saturday.
