She's the church-going actress who has been a devout Christian since her teenage years. But on Friday, Pia Miller revealed that she no longer considers herself to be religious. The 36-year-old shared the surprising news on Instagram after being asked about her religious beliefs by a fan. 'I have a faith-filled life. But I'm not religious,' shared the Chilean-born beauty. The revelation comes as a surprise after Pia had a religious fish tattooed on her right hip.  The actress spoke about her Christian faith, which she discovered as a teenager, in an interview with Elle Australia in 2017. 'I was always curious and I've always thought broadly and widely about who we are, where we come from, what this means, and when I stumbled across Christianity, I fell in love with that aspect of it,' she said. 'Not the institution, not religion or what can seem like dogma, but the relational aspect between human and God, that exchange, and the principles of how we ought to treat each other.' While married to footballer Brad Miller, Pia sent her sons Isiah, 16, and Lennox, 12, to Sunday School. The family was also seen at church most weekends. Brad and Pia split in 2016 after 10 years together. She is now dating Patrick Whitesell, an American multi-millionaire. They are believed to have started dating in May, following the breakdown of Patrick's marriage to Lauren Sanchez, who is now reportedly engaged to Amazon boss Jeff Bezos. Patrick is the CEO of Hollywood talent agency WME, which represents Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, and Hugh Jackman.
