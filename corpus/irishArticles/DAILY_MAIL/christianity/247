An African American college football player has been praised after he asked a cop if he could pray for his safety as they dined in a restaurant in Florida.  Cameron Tucker, a deputy with the Volusia County Sheriff’s Office, was having dinner with his wife Justine when the young man approached them, saying he felt 'compelled' to talk to them.  Mrs Tucker said Juan O’Neal asked their permission to say a prayer for her husband's 'protection', causing the pair to 'cry their eyes out'. Wife Justine posted the heartwarming photo on Facebook, showing the teenager placing a hand on the cop's shoulder as he closes his eyes to pray. She said that the incredible scene was a moment she would 'never forget'.  'Tonight we had an amazing encounter with an incredible young man named Juan,' she wrote. 'He came up to Cameron and asked is he could pray over him and his protection. After crying my eyes out we got to have an amazing conversation with this gentleman.  'You could feel His presence in the room. He said that he had felt compelled to talk to us and to pray over Cameron.' The post won praise for Juan, from Georgia, and thousands of people commented on the post with praise.  'What a beautiful story! Juan, may God continue to bless you as well. Keep sharing your faith young man, we need more of that in this world,' one wrote. 'God bless you young man we need more people like you', another commented. The teenager, a football player at Stetson University and a member of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, has racked up followers on Instagram for his inspirational videos preaching about his faith in God.  He even performs songs and raps he has written, which deliver the message of God and Christianity.
