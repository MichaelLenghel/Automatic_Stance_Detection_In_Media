A pregnant woman under a statue of the Virgin Mary, a man carrying a gigantic crucifix on the back of a moped and a pensioner with startling turquoise eyes. These are just some of the quirky characters captured on film by British photographer Sam Gregg in Naples. Sam says he took this extraordinary series of images in the Italian city to offset the negative reputation it has gained for poverty, crime and gang violence and its association with the Camorra mafia. He called the collection 'See Naples and Die' - a quote from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's Italian Journey written in 1786. The German poet thought the city was so enchanting that any visitor would be tempted to stay for life. Sam says: 'I am far from discrediting the issue of the Camorra as it remains a real and pressing concern, I am merely attempting to humanise the areas' inhabitants, showing that those who are effected are vibrant, tangible souls before they're political units.' The photos were all taken in the central Naples areas of Forcella, Quartieri Spagnoli, Rione Sanità and Santa Lucia.
