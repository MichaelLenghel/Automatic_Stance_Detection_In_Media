A proposal to water down Christmas festivities has been met with strong backlash. The City of Perth's Cultural Development Plan promises to deliver a Christmas season that is 'representative and inclusive of city's multicultural community'. Residents have taken to social media to express their outrage over the idea, with many claiming the council is going too far.  'This is just madness in my opinion. I'd love a Christmas as Christmassy as it can get,' one man wrote.  'PC gone mad,' wrote another. 'Absolutely what a great idea the world needs less joy throughout the year we have too much good news, community spirit love and happiness,' another wrote. However, one man thought it was a good idea.  'It'll still be festive guys, just more broad and inclusive,' the man wrote.  Chief Commissioner Andrew Hammond said the council's current holiday-season celebrations did not acknowledge or create a sense of belonging for non-Christians. 'We're not about to change Christmas celebrations. We're just taking a common sense approach that about 50 per cent of people are Christians and about 50 per cent are not,' he told 9News.  'While Christianity is an important part of Perth's cultural identity (46 per cent of Greater Perth demographic), the City of Perth's current holiday-season celebrations, which include a nativity scene at Council House, do not fully acknowledge or create a sense of belonging for the remaining 54 per cent, including 32 per cent who have no religion at all,' the plan states. The council has consulted a number of community groups about its plan, it said.
