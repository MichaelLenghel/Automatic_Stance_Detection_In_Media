Stunning images show the last frail members of a tribe that used to behead people and parade their bloodied skulls around as a gruesome rite of passage. The final Konyak headhunters, pictured with jewellery crafted from dead animals and sporting facial tattoos marking their battlefield skill, are now set to take their unique culture to the grave when the last member dies. They still live in their ancient homeland in mountainous Nagaland, north-east India, but tribal members are now aged in their eighties, with some even claiming to be more than 100 years old. The villagers used to hack skulls off a person's body and display them in pride of place in the village, celebrating the killer's achievement. However, despite their fearsome reputation, the practice was abandoned in the 1960s when they were converted to Christianity. This means that as this generation passes away, the last of headhunters will go with them. A book, named 'The Konyak: Last of the Tattooed Headhunters', tries to tell the story of their lives through the great-granddaughter of prominent tribal member Ahon. Part of it focuses on how the body is treated as a canvas, with inscriptions on the skin representing a rite of passage or, in some cases, every kill they have made.  These astonishing images were taken by Polish photographer Wiktor Stadniczenko, who travelled to their homes and even drunk tea with them around the campfire.
