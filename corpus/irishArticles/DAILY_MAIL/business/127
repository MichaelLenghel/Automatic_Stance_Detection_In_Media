Debbie Harry & Iggy Pop cemented their musical legacies in a ceremony at a Footprints in February event at the New York City clothing store I NEED MORE on Monday. The musical icons embraced and kissed at the event, in which they both put their hand prints and shoe prints into cement. The Blondie singer, 74, donned a black leather jacket over a red button-up top with black pants and boots and a gold necklace. The Miami-born vocalist had her trademark blonde locks parted to the side. Pop, 72, donned an all-black ensemble of a leather jacket over a shirt with jeans and boots, with his brown locks down at the gathering. The Godfather of Punk last month received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, which he said surprised him after he'd never gotten a Grammy in the years preceding. The Lust For Life artist joked with People about receiving the news. 'I said, "I'm not talking to them!" It's been, what? 50 years? No Grammy!' the Rock and Roll Hall of Famer said. 'But they said, "You won." 'And I said, "Well, is there anything I have to do? Is it contingent on anything?" And they said, "No. It can never be changed." So I thought that was okay. That was nice.' The Passenger artist said he's 'become satisfied' with his career accolades after more than 50 years in the business. 'I certainly never gave myself a moment to think, "This is never gonna happen for me,"' he said. 'No. Hell no. I just kept chipping away at it, and it's become satisfying.' Also on hand was musician Henry Rollins, and Guns N Roses bassist Duff McKagan with his wife Susan Holmes McKagan and daughter Grace McKagan.
