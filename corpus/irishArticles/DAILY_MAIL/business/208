US billionaire Dan Loeb has kicked off a campaign to break up retirement savings company Prudential and end its 172-year presence in the UK. Through his £11bn hedge fund Third Point, Loeb wrote to the board of Prudential yesterday telling them that he wanted it to spin off its Asian business and its US arm into separate firms. London-listed Prudential cut ties with its European savings and investment business M&G last year, floating M&G on the stock market as a separate firm. But Loeb thinks PruAsia and the US annuities firm Jackson are worth more individually than they are together. He said that there was little logic to the company’s structure, which has its head office in London but operates in the US and Asia. And he added that if investors retained a stake in both businesses, they could see the value of that stake double following the split. Loeb said: ‘PruAsia is materially undervalued by investors simply because it is coupled with Jackson, which accounts for a small portion of Prudential plc’s value but is extremely complex to analyse and carries a different risk and reward profile.’ He added that management’s ‘short-sighted’ policy of continuing to pay dividends had caused Prudential to forgo new investment in its business, which had ‘stunted growth’. And he hinted that he would call for a shake-up of the executives. Loeb has taken a 5pc stake in Prudential worth around £1.8bn. Shares fell 4.6pc or 68.5p to 1420.5p, though the market closed before Loeb published his letter.
