Thieves stole two luxury portable toilets worth £50,000 in a daring ram-raid. The thugs used a 4x4 to smash through a 10-foot tall, locked metal gate in Waterlooville, Hampshire, at 7.43pm on February 18. They then towed away two 18-foot long trailers containing the toilets, which are used for hire at events such as summer festivals. Dramatic CCTV footage of the raid shows a 4x4 being reversed into the gate sending it smashing to the floor with an immense crash. The car then turns around and drives into the yard belonging to toilet hire company Convenient Hire Limited. The car is then seen again as it tows the large trailer out of the area. A second car then appears in shot, reversing so it is in line ready to tow another valuable toilet. The car then drives away with the trailer as the clip comes to an end.  David Poynton, one of the company's directors, said the equipment was booked to bring in £10,000 of business from events over the summer.  Mr Poynton said: 'I was surprised that while they were ram raiding and charging the gate to the ground, there was a cyclist who went past and a number of people just walking by.  'I thought in this day and age people were photographing everything – or that they would report it to the police at least.'  The toilets are off-white in colour with Convenient Hire in gold writing on the outside.  A police spokesman said: 'One of the toilet units had lights on the back and one didn't – neither of them had number plates.  'On viewing CCTV it can be seen that members of the public have passed this incident taking place.'
