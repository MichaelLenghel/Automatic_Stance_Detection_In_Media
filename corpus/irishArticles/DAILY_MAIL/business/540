She has one of the most incredible figures in the business.    And on Friday, Swedish-Australian model Kelly Gale showed off her toned physique in activewear as she exercised at the gym.  The 24-year-old Victoria's Secret star worked on her flexibility, abs and 'booty' during the sweat session.  Kelly wore a black crop top and leggings and shared snippets of her workout on Instagram for fans.   For some gym exercises, she used a booty band to help sculpt her figure. Beside her were weights and an exercise ball.  She made sure to stretch during the session and then enjoyed a run outside, saying she's becoming faster and stronger after doing running intervals at the beach.    'Got used to running intervals in the soft sand on the beach, making running here seem easy,' she said. It's not the first time Kelly has shared snippets of her workout routines.     In January, Kelly told fans that she isn't a gym addict and that she hasn't weighed herself since she was thirteen. She also recommended getting plenty of sleep, explaining that she aims for eight hours each night, but can easily sleep for up to 12 hours or more. Kelly said she builds muscle with clean eating and regular training sessions, but when it comes to fitness, she chooses tennis and hiking over the gym. When it comes to losing weight on her legs specifically, the brunette recommends cardio, skipping, and boxing.
