Damaging winds, heavy rainfall, flash flooding and large hailstones are forecast to impact Perth and the metropolitan area. A severe thunderstorm alert issued for the Greater Perth area on Tuesday advises to find shelter away from trees, powerlines, storm water drains and streams. Thunderstorms detected by the Bureau of Meteorology near Joondalup are moving south. Wind speeds of up to 126 km/h were recorded at Kalannie at 4.17pm. Satellite imagery also showed lightning activity associated with the thunderstorm. "The storm cell has brought heavy rains and lightning that has damaged poles and in some cases brought down powerlines," a Western Power spokesman said. The company said about 18,000 customers in the metropolitan area have been affected by storm-related outages that are being answered by emergency response crews. Another 4000 homes and business outside of the metropolitan area were also impacted.
