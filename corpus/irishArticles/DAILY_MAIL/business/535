She recently wrapped filming on her latest production and acting role in Yes Day.  But Jennifer Garner isn't slowing down anytime soon, she took a business meeting in Santa Monica.   The actress, 47, looked chic in a cozy outfit as she headed to her car on Friday.  The 13 Going on 30 actress paired a black midi skirt, with knee-high black leather boots with a tall heel.  Her marled grey, black and white turtle neck sweater featured small feathered sleeve cuffs.  Garner carried a large black tote on her shoulder while chatting on the phone.  The mother-of-three's signature brunette locks were down in a sleek style.    She juggles her glittering Hollywood career with raising her three children - Violet, 14, Seraphina, 11, and Samuel, seven. She shares the kids with her former husband Ben Affleck and the two co-parent the youngsters. The couple had tied the knot in 2005 after working together on the movies Pearl Harbor in 2001 and Daredevil in 2003. But they called in quits exactly ten years to the day in 2015.  Despite their split Jennifer stood by Ben as he subsequently sought treatment for alcohol addiction, finally finalizing their divorce in October 2018. Jennifer's latest movie, Yes Day, follows the story of parents who attempt to make it through an entire day by only saying, 'yes' to their children's requests. The film is taken from Amy Krouse Rosenthal's book of the same name, and follows the idea which Jennifer honors annually with her own children.
