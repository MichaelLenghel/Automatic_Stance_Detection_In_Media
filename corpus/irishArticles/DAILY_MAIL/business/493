The Duchess of Sussex's best friend has begun making plans for a series of international charities in Harry and Meghan's name. Fashion stylist Jessica Mulroney, whose children were pageboys and a flower girl at the Duke and Duchess's wedding in 2018, registered the website sussexglobalcharities.com last Wednesday through her charity the Shoebox Project Foundation, which supports vulnerable women.  It comes after the Duke and Duchess were told they would no longer be able to use their Sussex Royal brand when they officially quit the monarchy next month.  Earlier this year, The Mail on Sunday revealed how Andrew Meyer, the Duchess's US business manager, registered two websites, archefoundation.com and archefoundation.org, on October 23, 2018 – just eight days after Meghan revealed she was pregnant. In September, he renewed the trademark for The Tig, her lifestyle blog which was shut down in 2017.
