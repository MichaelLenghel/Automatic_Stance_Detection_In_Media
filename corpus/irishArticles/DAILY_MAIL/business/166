Tory MPs have warned new Chancellor Rishi Sunak they could vote against his Budget if he raises fuel duty. Mr Sunak, who was only appointed this month, is understood to be considering ending the nine-year-long freeze on the levy.  MPs and motoring groups have warned an attempt to hit drivers on March 11 would be a mistake.  Fuel duty has been kept at 57.95p per litre for petrol and diesel since 2011. Robert Halfon, a Conservative MP and former minister who has long led a campaign for fuel duty cuts, said: ‘A fuel duty rise doesn’t just impact motorists – but hits food prices, public services, ambulance costs and business costs and could have an impact on employment.’ Mr Sunak is thought to have abandoned a planned tax grab on high-earners’ pensions after a Tory backlash.
