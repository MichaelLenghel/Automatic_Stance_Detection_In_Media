Connie Crayden's disapproving mother, Rina, made a return during Monday's episode of Married At First Sight. And a disapproving Rina again used it as an opportunity to try and convince Connie, 27, to leave the show.  Shortly after arriving at Connie and husband Jonethen Musulin's apartment for lunch, Rina let her feelings be known.   When a producer asked if she had been curious to get to know Jonethen, 27, Rina responded bluntly: 'No, not at all.' She was later asked if she thought Jonethen was a good match for Connie, with Rina again responding, 'No.' During lunch, Connie admitted her relationship with Jonethen had been 'hard', and was left visibly upset when her mum tried to downplay it. 'When you truly both meet someone and you decide to get married, it will be different,' Rina told them.  Connie's sister Charlotte seemed to side with their mother, telling her there 'wasn't a guaranteed fairytale ending'.  But Jonethen's mum, Lorella, urged them to work through their problems, leaving Rina glaring at her in disbelief. 'Connie obviously is my one concern. If you're really unhappy in this, Connie, then come home,' Rina said bluntly. She continued: 'Conn, get your stuff. Let's go.'   After their tense confrontation at lunch, Rina then sat Connie down for a one-on-one conversation. 'I am sorry about being rude, but yeah, I was concerned. You know, if he's not making you happy, you can't continue with this,' she told her daughter. A silent Connie just stared at her mother telling her that while she understood her concerns, she was 'okay'.  'Jonny and I have ups and downs, and you've just caught us in a down moment,' she explained. But Rina tried one more time to convince Connie to walk away from the experiment and Jonethen. 'If you are emotionally getting involved or upset with this, then as a concerned mum, I don't think you should be doing this,' she said. Confessing that she may have been 'a little bit negative' about the whole experiment, Rina insisted she was only looking out for Connie's interests. 'I know you. I think, Connie, he is too full on for you. I don't think he has quiet time. I don't think he'll read a book with ya, sit under a tree and read a book,' she explained. Rina later said she was leaving it 'up to them' to work out their differences, despite the fact she was still concerned. 'I don't think any bloke is good enough for my daughter though!' she laughed.  Meanwhile, later in the episode, Steve Burley had a meltdown after an emotional conversation with Mishel Karen's daughter, Eva. Their discussion had triggered emotions for the 51-year-old regarding his estranged son, who lives in the United Kingdom.  'I've got no family around me. All I've got is my business and my friends,' he told Mishel before inhaling sharply.  He then fell silent, telling Mishel, 48, he was feeling 'a little bit emotional' following his chat with Eva. 'I love my son, Mishel. And he was due to come over here. And I haven't said anything to anyone, or told anyone, because I was super excited about it,' he said. 'I haven't seen him for so long... It would have been really good. It would have been really good to see him,' he added, breaking down in tears.  Married At First Sight continues Tuesday at 7.30pm on Channel Nine
