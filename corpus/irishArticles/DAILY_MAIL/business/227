A wild brawl broke out in a popular late night eatery after revellers stormed in demanding free food, its owner claims.  CCTV footage captured the fight between the owner of the Falafel House restaurant and customers at 3am on Sunday on Hindley Street in central Adelaide. Business owner George Alkoury said the wild scenes erupted when three women stormed into his shop demanding a meal on the house.  Footage showed one of the women throw a bottle and another hurl a drink at Mr Alkoury as he stood behind the counter, before he approached the group to remove them from his store. 'Out!' Mr Alkoury yelled as another customer stepped in to break up the scuffle, before one of the women threw a chair.  'I'm very scared,' Mr Alkoury told 9News after the incident.  Mr Alkoury hid behind a stool to protect himself and called police as the women continue to thrash around the store before leaving. He claimed police took too long to respond to his call for help. 'What is going on? Very busy police? Sorry, it's not an excuse this one,' he said.  'Who gives you power to attack me?' Mr Alkoury said. 'This is my business, my job.'  Mr Alkoury said the popular Hindley Street entertainment precinct needs a greater police presence to stop incidents like this from occurring.  His calls were backed by The West End Traders Association. South Australian Police say their staff levels on the strip are adequate, with more units able to be deployed on the street at any time.
