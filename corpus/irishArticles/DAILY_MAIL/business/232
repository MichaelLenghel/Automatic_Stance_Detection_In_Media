Two New York Rangers players sustained non-life-threatening injuries Sunday night in a car crash in Brooklyn, N.Y. Goaltender Igor Shesterkin, who was driving, broke a rib and will be reevaluated in two weeks. Forward Pavel Buchnevich was a passenger and is listed as day-to-day after avoiding any serious injuries, team president John Davidson announced Monday. They were taken to New York Presbyterian Hospital for evaluation. "Igor was driving and apparently a vehicle pulled a U-turn in front of them and there was a collision," Davidson said. "The air bags were deployed immediately and the seat belts were being worn by both players and thankfully for that, and I mean thankfully for that." Shesterkin, 24, made his NHL debut on Jan. 7 and is 9-1-0 with a 2.23 goals-against average and .940 save percentage in 10 games this season. He has emerged as the team's No. 1 goalie, ahead of Henrik Lundqvist and Alexandar Georgiev. Buchnevich, 24, has 14 goals and 23 assists in 61 games this season. Since making his NHL debut with the Rangers in 2016-17, he has 138 points (57 goals, 81 assists) in 240 games. "In our business, you're certainly dealt curveballs all the time," Davidson said. "That's a tough curveball we have to deal with." The Rangers next play Tuesday against the New York Islanders. --Field Level Media
