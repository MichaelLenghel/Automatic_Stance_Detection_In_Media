LONDON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs has restricted all business travel to, from and within South Korea and the Northern Italian regions of Lombardy and Veneto in the wake of the coronavirus spread, a staff memo seen by Reuters on Tuesday shows. The Wall Street lender has also advised staff to postpone all non-essential travel to, from and within the rest of Italy, as well as other parts of Asia, excluding Australia, New Zealand and India, the memo said. Staff who have visited South Korea or the impacted regions of Italy have been asked to 'self-isolate' and stay away from the office for a minimum of 14 days.
