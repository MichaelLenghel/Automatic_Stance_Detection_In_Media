BERLIN, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Several sectors of Germany's manufacturing sector are expecting a shortness of supplies from the Far East region in the coming weeks due to the outbreak of the coronavirus in China, business association BDI said on Monday. The sectors affected include engineering, autos, pharmaceuticals and paper, BDI said in a statement.
