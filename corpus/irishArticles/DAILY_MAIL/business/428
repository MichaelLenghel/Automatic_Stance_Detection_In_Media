On Sunday's episode of Married At First Sight, Hayley Vernon got herself entangled in the breakdown of the relationship between Amanda Micallef and Tash Herz. Her unsolicited advice during the commitment ceremony led to Amanda telling Hayley to 'shut the f**k up'.  And fans at home were amused by the buff brunette's attempts to play relationship expert, taking to Twitter in droves to mock her comments.  One person wrote: 'Hayley has one good week in a fake relationship and she thinks she's Dr Phil. Mind your own business.'  Another chimed in: 'Hayley thinks she's an expert!' Yet another viewer Tweeted: 'Hayley is all of a sudden professional! So glad she got told to stfu'.  Someone else wrote: 'Hayley lasted a week in a relationship and is now a relationship expert? Hospitals should hire me then cos I've watched the first two seasons of ER'.  Others were happy that Amanda stood up to Hayley, with one person adding a meme which stated, 'know your role and shut your mouth'.    As Amanda and Tash first sat in front of the experts on Sunday, they began fighting.  Amanda raged: 'Tash, you decided the day after the wedding that I wasn't your cup and tea, and we were done. Everyone here has had issues - and do you see anyone else running for the hills?' Hayley then interrupted Amanda, explaining that her 'husband' Dave Cannon initially fled her on their honeymoon, but they've since found happiness, saying: 'There have been people in the same situation, don't try and say that yours is the worst.' Amanda responded: 'Hayley, with all due respect, this is our f**king fight now, pipe it. I don't want to fight with you or anyone here. This is not about you, shut the f**k up.'
