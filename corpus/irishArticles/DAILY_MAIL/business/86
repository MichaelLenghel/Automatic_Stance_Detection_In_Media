They're one of the strongest couples on this season of Married At First Sight. And on Tuesday, Ivan Sarakula and Aleksandra Markovic expressed their romantic feelings for each other by sharing a cringeworthy tongue kiss. The noisy lip lock lasted for an excruciating 15 seconds, with the smooching sound of the couple kissing ringing out across their apartment. Despite their obvious passion, the pair became cagey earlier that day when questioned about their sex life by Ivan's family and Aleks' friends over lunch.  'Why don't we all just get this out of the way,' Aleks' friend said. 'Have you guys slept together?' After an awkward pause, Ivan responded: 'I don't think that's anyone's business.' Aleks then chimed in: 'Ivan's parents are sitting right in front of me. I certainly respect where I come from and [respect] my parents. 'I'm 26 years old and as far as my parents are aware, I'm still a virgin, and I never need to speak to my parents about that sort of [thing].' She finished: 'My parents don't speak to me about their sex life and I don't want to know about it. It's a respectful thing.' While they avoided revealing whether they'd consummated their marriage or not, Ivan's father still gave the pair his stamp of approval.  'Intimacy is not everything,' he said. 'It's very early days at the moment, from what I can see you're getting on extremely well. More than a friendly basis.' 'We've got chemistry,' Aleks added. Ivan's mum then said that an 'emotional and mental component' of a marriage is more important than sex, which Aleks agreed with.  The couple finished by admitting that there was a strong chance that they could fall in love. Married At First Sight continues Wednesday at 7.30pm on Channel Nine
