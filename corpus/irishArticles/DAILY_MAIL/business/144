John Lyng's first-half earnings have leapt by almost 80 per cent as extreme weather such as Sydney hailstorms and Townsville floods helped lift the insurance builder's sales revenue by more than 50 per cent. The Sydney-based company told the ASX on Tuesday its net profit after tax increased by 1.2 per cent to $7.9 million, although this equated to a 60 per cent increase on the year before when $2.9 million non-recurring gain on sale was excluded. Johns Lyng's first-half normalised earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation were up 77.7 per cent to $20 million, while total sales revenue increased by 53.1 per cent to $233.7 million. The company, which repairs damaged properties for insurers, said the result was driven by a consistently high volume of business-as-usual activity in its insurance building and restoration services segment, which recorded a 41.5 per cent increase in sales revenue. It also said the Sydney hailstorms in December 2018 and Townsville floods in early 2019 contributed to its catastrophic events sales revenue jumping by 154.4 per cent to $38.2 million. Chief executive Scott Didier said Johns Lyng had built an unrivalled capacity to respond and assist in driving recovery efforts when extreme events occurred. "While weather and accidents are unpredictable, it's certainly no fluke that we achieve results like this," he told the ASX on Tuesday. "The events serve as a reminder not only of our capacity to respond but equally the fact that our performance is not tied to regular economic cycles. Rather, we are linked to the vagaries of the environment". Mr Didier said the company was also in the midst of responding to six non-forecast "catastrophic" events, including the summer bushfires and recent storms in NSW and Victoria. "These have led to an unprecedented record number of registrations and job volumes and we expect these to be reflected in performance in the second half of FY20 and into FY21," he said. The company announced a fully franked interim dividend of 1.8 cents per share. Johns Lyng stocks had risen by 3.07 per cent, or eight cents, to $2.69 by 1452 AEDT.
