South Australia has been urged to "lift its game" to attract more skilled and business migrants. Business SA's migration expert Sherrie Gaskin says SA has fallen behind the eastern states in attracting skilled workers. "South Australia needs to lift its game," Ms Gaskin said. "If we can focus on boosting skilled migration, we'll also encourage more people to come to South Australia and in turn increase our population. "Business migrants can also bolster two-way trade." Last year, the federal government recognised SA had different business and economic challenges compared to other states and introduced a number of regional visa options to attract workers. "Regional businesses often tell us how difficult it can be to find skilled workers," Ms Gaskin said. "If we can help businesses when they need it the most, the whole state will benefit," she said.
