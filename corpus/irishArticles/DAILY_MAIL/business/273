The 2020 season of MasterChef is slated to be the most nail-biting to date.  On Monday, contestant Hayden Quinn told The Daily Telegraph that this will be 'the most nerve-racking' series of the show yet. The chef, who previously appeared on season three of the cooking competition, revealed that going up against other experienced chefs was a challenge.   All 24 contestants in the upcoming season are previous contenders who have gone on to have successful careers in the culinary world. 'The most nerve-racking thing was the fact that I'm going up against these amazing cooks,' the Sydney cook said. He added: 'It's so important to back yourself and have that self-confidence that you really need to do well.'  Hayden recently told TV Tonight he was back to win, revealing: 'MasterChef changed my life. I'm stoked to be going up against the best of the best. I've learnt a lot, my skills have improved, I'm here to take it out'.  Since appearing on the show in 2011, Hayden has gone on to have an illustrious career as a chef, author, television judge and presenter. He's not the only one with unfinished business, with season one runner up Poh Ling Yeow, 47, also returning. Preparing to give them a run for their money is the third runner up from season one, Chris Badenoch, 51. The 'head-to-tail' enthusiast was best known for serving up a whole roasted pig's head, duck neck sausage and chocolate stout tiramisu called 'beeramisu'. Also included in the lineup are Emelia Jackson, Harry Foster, Jess Liemantara, Khanh Ong, Laura Sharrad, Lynton Tapp, Reece Hignell, Reynold Poernomo, Rose Adam, Sarah Clare, Sarah Tiong, Simon Toohey, Tessa Boersma and Tracy Collins.
