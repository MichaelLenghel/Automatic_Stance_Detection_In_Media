Friends and family of late rapper Pop Smoke were set to remember his life at a prayer and grief service at a church in his native Brooklyn Sunday. The rapper, 20, was fatally shot in the torso Wednesday in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles in an incident investigators continue to probe with help from the rapper's relatives. Insiders told TMZ Sunday that the rapper's body was set to be flown back to New York for a burial later on. Relatives of the late rap artist, whose full name was Bashar Barakah Jackson, have been taking care of his business arrangements in California, sources told the outlet. No arrests have been made in the shooting, authorities told the outlet, as surveillance video culled from the scene indicate the rapper was likely targeted in the shooting. The video showed four masked men heading toward the house the rapper was in at about 4:30 a.m., sources told the outlet Thursday. The men first went around the back of the home, then three were seen heading around the home's side, en route to the front of the abode.  The fourth man was later seen heading out of the front of the home, but did not appear to be taking anything with him. Some had suspected that the incident was a premeditated robbery after the rapper left identifying information in a series of social media posts in which he was seen with large amounts of cash and other valuables. Following the shooting, the Welcome to the Party artist was transported to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where doctors would pronounce him dead.  Following his death, stars including Nicki Minaj, Snoop Dogg, Chance the Rapper, 50 Cent and Kylie Jenner paid tribute to him on social media.
