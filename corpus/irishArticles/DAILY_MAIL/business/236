A curious hippo stunned drivers when it turned up for a late night visit to a petrol station in South Africa in astonishing footage.  In a clip captured on Sunday, the animal can be seen approaching the busy forecourt of an Engen service station in Saint Lucia.  Shocked customers watch on as the hippo strolls past a row of petrol pumps before making its way into the centre of the station and glancing at approaching headlights. Garage owner Anel Snyman said, despite it seeming like an unusual sight, the local area is a popular spot for visiting hippos.  Saint Lucia is on the coast of north east South Africa and is famed for its beaches and turtle watching, as well as hippos and Nile crocodiles.  Mr Snyman said: 'This is quite normal in St. Lucia, especially in the streets further from the main road. The hippos really just roam around and mind their own business. 'St. Lucia is part of the iSimangaliso Wetland Park, and the town is surrounded by a large lake, beaches and forestry.  'Hippos are dangerous, and we do warn guests not to get too close to them or to shine bright lights in their eyes.  'This one might have been hungry for snacks, but they are herbivores, so they really just want to graze and mind their own business.'  Hippos can run at nearly 20mph on land but are often most dangerous in the water where they have been known to aggressively charge boats. The huge animals are herbivores but can use their huge mouths and tusks to fight, even crushing crocodiles.
