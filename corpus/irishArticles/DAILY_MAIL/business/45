Tesco has waved goodbye to its China business as it offloaded its remaining stake to its joint venture partner for £275million.  The UK's biggest supermarket, which has been diminishing its presence in Asia, has struggled to crack the Chinese market. Today it said it has agreed to sell its 20 per cent stake in the Gain Land joint venture to a unit of its state-run partner China Resources Holdings.    'The disposal allows Tesco to further simplify and focus the business on its core operations,' it said in a short statement. Tesco combined its 131 stores Chinese stores with partner CRH's almost 3,000 sites in 2014.   The exit from China follows that from South Korea in 2015, when it sold the business for £4billion to help shore up the balance sheet following an accounting scandal.  In December last year, it said it was considering to sell its Thai and Malaysian businesses after an approach by an unnamed buyer, although those businesses still remain unsold.  Now that the supermarket has exited China too, a possible exit from Thailand and Malaysia would reduce Tesco's non-UK operations to central Europe and Ireland.  Tesco has 1,967 stores in Thailand and 74 stores in Malaysia and has been operating in Asia for over 20 years.   The disposal of sites in Asia comes as chief executive Dave Lewis winds down his tenure at the retail firm, before new chief Ken Murphy takes over in the summer.  Tesco shares fell 0.5 per cent to 248.10p in afternoon trading
