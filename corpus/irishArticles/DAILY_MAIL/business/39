A severe storm has hit Perth during the afternoon peak hour, downing trees and powerlines, causing flash flooding and damaging buildings. The Bureau of Meteorology issued a severe thunderstorm alert for the greater Perth area on Tuesday afternoon as wind speeds of up to 126km/h were recorded at Kalannie at 4.17pm. The Department of Fire and Emergency Services said the State Emergency Service received more than 120 requests for help, including reports of trees falling on cars. The roof at Morley Galleria shopping centre was damaged, with water seen gushing through the ceiling, ABC reported, while the roof of Ocean Reef Shopping Centre was also reportedly damaged. Western Power said about 18,000 customers in the metropolitan area were affected by storm-related outages. Another 4000 homes and business outside of the metropolitan area were also impacted. "The storm cell has brought heavy rains and lightning that has damaged poles and in some cases brought down powerlines," a spokesman said. Town of Victoria Park said the Town's tree contractor was attending to significant issues after the storm, and workers would begin a general clean-up on Wednesday morning.
