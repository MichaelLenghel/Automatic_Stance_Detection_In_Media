This is the shocking moment a New York city councilman berated two police officers in a foul-mouthed tirade where he declared, 'I'm your f**king boss!'   Newburgh Councilman Omari Shakur launched his heated 20-minute rant after a police officer honked at him and ordered him to move his car as he was sitting in the opposite lane of traffic on a street.  The confrontation on Tuesday was caught on a police body camera and shows the moment Shakur explodes at the officers saying, 'Then get the f**k out of my face then! I'm your f**king boss!'   Now Shakur, who was elected in November, is being accused by police unions of making threats and using 'abusive' language toward a police detective and another officer.   However, Shakur says that the detective threatened him and told him to be careful or he'd 'end up like your son'.   Shakur's 23-year-old son Antonio 'Tony' Bryant was shot and killed by police in 2006.  In the incident on Tuesday, Shakur's car was sitting in the middle of Carpenter Avenue in Newburgh in the opposite lane of traffic when a police car stopped behind him and the two cops inside honked at him and flashed their lights.  Video captured on a cop's body camera shows an officer approach Shakur's car, where he's seated in the driver's seat talking to another officer.  'Just give me your license and registration so we can be on our way,' the officer wearing the body camera said.  'I'm not giving you nothing... f**king arrest me cause I'm sitting here taking care of business,' Shakur responded.  'I'm your f***ing boss. Get the f**k out of here,' he repeated.  'Arrest me or get the f**k out of my face. I'm not giving it to you, I'm not giving it to you,' he repeats, refusing to provide his driver's license.  He refused to show his ID because he claimed he didn't do anything to warrant showing it to officers.  A cop then forces the car door open and the officers repeat: 'Mr. Shakur, Mr. Shakur, can you please show us your ID'. In the end the cops walk away from his car and he starts to blast music and bop to it, refusing to move his vehicle.    The alleged threat about Shakur's son wasn't caught on the police bodycam footage. He claimed the first officer who approached him made a threat about his son.  The shocking video has been viewed tens of thousands of times.  Shakur issued a statement apologizing for his conduct in the video on Saturday, saying: 'I want to apologize to the residents of our city for the way I responded in a recent police police encounter. 'The reaction displayed is not who I am and I fell short of the love that I feel amongst my constituents in Newburgh and of the leadership I want to represent,' he added. 'Before the video footage there were approximately 15 minutes of unrecorded interaction with an undercover officer during which I was subjected to direct and personal harassment that were deeply disrespectful to me, my deceased son and family,' he said.   City Mayor Torrance Harvey condemned the tirade, saying: 'Unprofessional, unacceptable... an no one, whether you're an elected official or not, should speak to any law enforcement officer in that regard'. A city council meeting is scheduled for Monday night where the video will be addressed.  The confrontation is currently under investigation by an outside agency.
