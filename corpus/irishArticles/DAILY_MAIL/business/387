New chief executive Chris Ashton said the company had been focused on delivering the benefits of the ECR acquisition at a cost of $81 million in the first half. "We have increased our cost synergy target to $175 million per annum, delivered over 30 months from completion, " he said on Monday as he started in the role following the retirement of Andrew Wood. Worley's initial estimate was about $130 million to $150 million in cost savings from IT, property and business overheads after the merger. There will be a one-off cost of about $125 million for delivering the synergy target, plus capital expenditure of $15 million, Worley said on Monday.
