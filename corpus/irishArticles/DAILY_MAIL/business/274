Stock markets in Asia were lower Tuesday after Wall Street recorded its worst session in two years and fears of the coronavirus weakening the world economy cause the Dow Jones Industrial Average to plunge more than 1,000 points. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dipped a small .2 percent to 26,777.88 and up north, the Shanghai Composite index faltered 1.6 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 index dropped 3 percent to 22,686.61 after it reopened from a holiday on Monday, while the S&P ASX/200 dropped 1.2 percent to reach 6,896.10. South Korea’s Kospi managed to rebound slightly from a heavy loss on Monday, adding 0.6 percent to 2,091.80. Similarly, Singapore’s stock market rose as well but fell everywhere else in the region. Malaysia saw a decline in shares due to the recent political upheaval of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad after he offered his resignation to Malaysia’s king when his political party quit the ruling alliance.  In the U.S., traders on Wall Street looked for safety in government bonds, gold and high-dividend stocks like utilities and real estate. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to the lowest level in more than three years.  The Dow lost 1,031.61 points, or 3.6% and the S&P 500 index skidded 3.4% to 3,225.89. The Nasdaq dropped 3.7% to 9,221.28, marking it’s biggest lost since December 2018. China, who is both a major importer of goods and a big player in intricate supply chains, has been forced to step back as more than 79,000 people have been infected with the new coronavirus that originated in the Hubei district of Wuhan. 'Stock markets around the world are beginning to price in what bond markets have been telling us for weeks - that global growth is likely to be impacted in a meaningful way due to fears of the coronavirus.' said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance. China still maintains the most infections and deaths of any other country at the moment, prompting the government to take drastic measures to ensure citizens health – even at the cost of business. People have been ordered to stay inside their homes as part as a very restrictive travel ban, leaving factories and other facilities idle. Economists have cut growth estimates for the Chinese economy. In response, China’s government has promised Monday to supply tax cuts and other aid to help companies recover lost revenue. Despite apprehension causing some sporadic trading in recent weeks, the majority of the world continues to trade as if the coronavirus will be temporary. Until Monday, the major U.S. stock indexes had all been in the green. Tech companies, whose supply chains have been disrupted by a viral outbreak, took the brunt of the market drop, which wiped out all of the Dow´s and S&P 500´s gains for the year.  Those tech companies include Apple Inc., who depends heavily on China for business, and caused the global company to lost 4.7 percent. Microsoft recorded similar loses at 4.3 percent. Banks like JPMorgan and Bank of America also took major hits.  Crude oil prices slid 3.7% on Monday but were stable early Tuesday. Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose 26 cents to $51.69 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It fell $1.95 to settle at $51.43 a barrel on Monday. Brent crude oil, the international standard, gained 28 cents to $56.06 per barrel. On Monday, it dropped $2.17 to close at $55.77 a barrel. Cruise lines suffered steep losses, as Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise Line were three of the top four decliners in the S&P 500, each falling around 9%.  American Airlines also dropped sharply, and after the market closed, United Airlines withdrew its earnings estimate for 2020 because of uncertainty over how long the virus outbreak will last. Gilead Sciences climbed 4.6% and was among the few bright spots. The biotechnology company is testing a potential drug to treat the new coronavirus. Bleach-maker Clorox was also a standout, rising 1.5%. Utilities and real estate companies held up better than most sectors.  Investors tend to favor those industries, which carry high dividends and hold up relatively well during periods of turmoil, when they're feeling fearful. They're now the best-performing sectors in the S&P 500 for the year, while the tech sector has lost ground. In the eyes of some analysts, stocks are finally catching up to the bond market, where fear has been dominant for months. Investors have turned to the safety of bonds throughout 2020, even as stocks overcame stumbles to set more records.  The 10-year yield had recovered to 1.40% early Tuesday after dipping to an intraday record low Monday of 1.325% set in July 2016, according to Tradeweb.  The 30-year Treasury yield fell further after setting its own record low, down to 1.83% from 1.92% late Friday. Gold retreated as shares steadied, losing $16.50 to $1,660.30 ounce, silver lost 28 cents to $18.60 per ounce and copper fell 3 cents to $2.59 per pound. The dollar rose to 110.85 Japanese yen from 110.68 yen on Monday. The euro strengthened to $1.0865 from $1.0853.
