Chancellor Rishi Sunak is facing pressure to halve air passenger duty in the Budget in a move which could slash up to £90 off the cost of a plane ticket. Passengers are charged the duty on all flights from the UK. The rate is £13 for a short-haul economy flight, rising to £172 for a long-haul trip in business or first class. It generates £3billion a year for the Treasury but 42 MPs, including 27 Tories, and three peers, have written to Mr Sunak to urge him to 'take decisive action to cut APD by at least 50 per cent'. They say is restricts the country's economic growth and burdens hardworking families who save hard to pay for their holidays. Their letter reads: 'Turning to tourism, APD acts as a deterrent to visiting the UK, as overseas visitors have to pay APD on their return flight which adds to their cost of visiting the UK.  'It also makes the hard earned holidays of UK residents more expensive. 'We believe that it is beyond debate that APD is not working at any level and that it is essential that you take decisive action to cut APD by at least 50% in your upcoming budget.' Tim Alderslade, of industry group Airlines UK, said: 'We welcome recognition of the need to address the impact of APD on domestic aviation and this should be dealt with now we've left the EU, however APD impacts all UK airlines flying all routes and to all destinations, and action is needed to tackle APD in its totality. 'Last month UK aviation committed to reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050.  'We can grow and decarbonise, and now is the time for Government to make global Britain a reality by tackling the sky-high APD levels that continue to hold airlines back.'
