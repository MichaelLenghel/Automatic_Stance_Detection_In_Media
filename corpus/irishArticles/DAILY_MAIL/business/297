Barclays is preparing to start the hunt for a new boss to replace Jes Staley, who is expected to leave the bank by the end of next year, according to the Financial Times. Staley's departure after five years at Barclays would follow recent chief executive changes in other top banks, including Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS and Credit Suisse. It comes as UK regulators are probing links between Staley and Jeffrey Epstein, the US financier who killed himself in jail last year while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. As head of JP Morgan's private bank, Staley came to know Epstein well and the pair stayed in touch until 2015 – seven years after Epstein was convicted of soliciting a child for prostitution. Staley has told colleagues he expects to leave Barclays by the end of 2021 and could step down at the annual meeting in May next year, the Financial Times said. Barclays is set to appoint an external headhunting firm to identify potential successors and the process could take up to a year, according to the report. It comes as RBS appointed Alison Rose as its new chief executive in September last year, while Tidjane Thiam quit as Credit Suisse chief executive earlier this month after a spying scandal that hit the bank's reputation. He's been replaced by head of the bank's Swiss business, Thomas Gottstein.  Meanwhile, HSBC still doesn't have a permanent boss, despite John Flint having left the bank in August last year. The banking giant appointed Noel Quinn as interim chief executive.
