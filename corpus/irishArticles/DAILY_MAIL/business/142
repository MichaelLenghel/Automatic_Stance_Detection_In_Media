The Victorian government is pumping nearly $100 million for innovations in the state's crippled recycling industry. The Labor government went on day two of selling its 10-year, waste crisis fix on Tuesday, unveiling $96.5 million in grants for businesses to turn recyclable goods into other products. There's money for businesses to build waste sorting facilities, increase recycling in their daily operations and a business innovation centre to solve waste woes. There is no "hard and fast number" on how much more capacity is needed to take the recyclables away from landfill, Premier Daniel Andrews told reporters at Coca-Cola Amatil in Melbourne. "Clearly there is a gap now and we need to try and fill that by a co-investment model," he said, adding more players were needed. Coca-Cola Amatil has already switched seven out of 10 of its bottles to 100 per cent recycled plastic, from Taiwan, and are working to get the others to that same point, the company told reporters. The grants are part of a 10-year plan being drip-fed out by the government. On Monday it revealed Victorians would eventually get four bins - general, food and organic, glass, and plastic, metal and paper - to better separate products and a container deposit scheme. But both would be years away. The government is yet to decide what form the container scheme will take, materials to be collected, and how much money people will get back. A dedicated waste authority will be established to ensure a basic service standard. GRANTS ANNOUNCEMENT: * An extra $28m for the Recycling Victoria Infrastructure Fund for businesses to build sort and process recycling infrastructure * $30m for technology to create products * $10m for businesses to reduce waste in daily operations * $10m for processors towards waste-to-energy initiatives * $11.5m to treat hazardous waste * $7m for a Business Innovation Centre
