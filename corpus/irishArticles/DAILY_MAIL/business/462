He's been dubbed Gen Z's It Boy.  And Luka Sabbat showed off his impeccable style sense Saturday as he put on a chic display in a black tuxedo at the 2020 Image Awards in Pasadena, California. The 22-year-old model was on his own at the award show, which occurred shortly after friends told Us Weekly he was 'purely friends' with fellow model Kendall Jenner, 24. Luka hit the red carpet in a well-tailored black tuxedo, which he paired with an eye-catching white shirt with vertical black stripes. He dressed the outfit down by leaving it unbuttoned and adding a slim black tie that was loosely hung around his neck, and he rounded out the look with a shiny pair of black cowboy boots. Luka wasn't nominated for anything at the Image Awards, the multicultural awards show. Luka is a rising star in the world of male fashion, and he's a regular fixture at social functions with models including Gigi and Bella Hadid. Lately, he's been seen spending time with Kendall Jenner, sparking speculation that the two might be dating, though a source tamped down those rumors Saturday in Us Weekly. 'There's nothing romantic going on with Kendall and Luka,' they said. 'They are purely friends and have been forever. Luka is still so close with Kendall and her family, even after his fling with Kourtney, and it's because he's such a fun, down to earth, cool guy.' The source referenced Luka's brief relationship with Kendall's older half-sister Kourtney Kardashian, 40. The two became an item in September 2018, shortly after she split from the Algerian-born boxer Younes Bendjima. In October of that year, Luka sounded rather nonchalant about the relationship while speaking with Us Weekly. 'It's all public,' he said. 'It doesn't even matter. There's no such thing as privacy in 2018. … I'm chilling. I just mind my own business.' Kourtney made it clear by February 2019 that the two were no longer dating.  Kendall sparked relationship rumors on Monday when she posted a series of photos after the Burberry fashion show in London featuring Luka. One image showed the two learning in over a candle-lit table as if they were about to kiss, while he gazed at the camera. They were previously spotted at the Longchamp show during New York Fashion Week, though they didn't attend sit together. The two models also enjoyed a lovely vacation in Monaco in May 2019.   ENTERTAINER OF THE YEAR Angela Basset Billy Porter Lizzo --WINNER Regina King Tyler Perry Motion Picture OUTSTANDING MOTION PICTURE Dolemite is My Name Harriet Just Mercy -- WINNER Queen & Slim Us OUTSTANDING ACTOR IN A MOTION PICTURE Chadwick Boseman, 21 Bridges Daniel Kaluuya, Queen & Slim Eddie Murphy, Dolemite is My Name Michael B.
