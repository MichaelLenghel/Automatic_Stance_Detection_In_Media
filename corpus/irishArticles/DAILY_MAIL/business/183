The Australian share market has slumped by 2.3 per cent in opening trade as coronavirus fears wiped another $50billion from stocks in just minutes. Wall Street was significantly weaker in the United States, which has in turn infected the Australian Securities Exchange.  The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 was 2.17 per cent weaker while the broader All Ordinaries index had slumped by 2.27 per cent in early Tuesday morning trade. Qantas was hit particularly hard, with the flying kangaroo airline's share price at one point plunging by 4.3 per cent. With Monday's $48billion losses factored in, the Australian share market has lost close to $100billion, or more than four per cent, in just two days. CommSec market analyst Steven Daghlian said coronavirus fears were affecting 98 per cent of stocks on the Australian market, from the resources sector to tourism-related firms. 'A number of companies have also warned of the potential lower profits linked to the virus,' he told Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday. 'Wide-reaching impacts on a number of different stocks and sectors and for now there's just a concern this is turning into a pandemic rather than just mostly being focused on China.'  The disease, also known as COVID-19, has infected 80,000 worldwide since it originated in December at an animal market in the Chinese city of Wuhan.  This includes 24 people now in Australia. Then there are another 47 Australians who are among the 219 confirmed cases of the coronavirus contracted on board Diamond Princess cruise ship at Yokohama in Japan.  Coronavirus has killed more than 2,600 people globally and can cause severe lung damage and trigger multiple organ failure, particularly among the elderly or frail. The Australian share market reached a record high on Thursday last week but the losses of Monday and Tuesday have wiped out the gains made in 2020 so far.  'We've wiped out most of the improvements over the course of the year,' Mr Daghlian said. 'We had three weeks of gains.' Meanwhile, a Roy Morgan market research survey of 1,170 Australian business found 15 per cent, or one in six of them, had been affected by the coronavirus.  NEW SOUTH WALES: 4   January 25 January 27  VICTORIA: 6 January 25 January 29 January 30 February 1  February 22   QUEENSLAND: 8 January 29 January 30 February 4 February 5   February 6 SOUTH AUSTRALIA: 3 February 1 WESTERN AUSTRALIA: 1 February 21   JAPAN: 15
