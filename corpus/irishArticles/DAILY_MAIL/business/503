Her mother Cindy Crawford was one of the most famous supermodels of the nineties.  But Kaia Gerber was giving Cindy a run for her money as she continued her reign on for Milan Fashion Week on Saturday, storming down Bottega Veneta's catwalk.  The model, 18, nailed androgynous chic in a oversized black suit from the Italian brand's Autumn/Winter 2020 collection collection showcase.  Kaia layered the single breasted blazer atop of an oversized lime silk shirt, which had longs sleeves adorned with silver studs.  The American beauty toted a matching woven handbag and strutted down the runway in patent black heels.  Kaia's hair was styled in a sleek straight centre-parting and her make-up was pared back for the smart business look.   Lime was a predominant feature on the catwalk, with the designer also showcasing asymmetric dresses with fringing and red latex ensembles.   During Milan Fashion Week, Kaia has walked for brands including Prada, Fendi, Moschino and Max Mara.   Earlier on Friday she led the models at Tod's runway show. The model made a bold style statement in an oversized beige coat and bright red tights on the catwalk.  She then joined the likes of Bella and Gigi Hadid, Kendall Jenner and Irina Shayk on the star-studded catwalk for Versace's Fall/Winter 2020 runway show.   Before jetting to Italy, Kaia walked in numerous shows during both London and New York Fashion Weeks, earlier this month.  The catwalk queen is the daughter of supermodel Cindy, 54, and male model turned businessman Rande Gerber, 57.   Kaia made her runway debut in 2017 and has since become one of the world's most in-demand models.
