Luxury sports clubs in prestigious suburbs across Australia have raked in millions of dollars in taxpayer-funded grants, while poor clubs were left with nothing.  The sports rorts scandal engulfing Nationals deputy leader Bridget McKenzie saw hefty grants from the federal government's $100million Community Sport Infrastructure scheme dished out to yacht clubs, pony clubs and even a golf club in Sydney's affluent northern beaches. But those in many less-affluent areas came away empty-handed, despite needing desperate maintenance work to even stay open.  Bayview Golf Club in the upmarket Sydney suburb of Mona Vale was gifted $140,000, despite raking in annual subscriptions of up to $2,830 each from its wealthy members. Brothers Rugby Club, Albion, Queensland: $500,000 Mosman Rowing Club, NSW: $500,000 Main Ridge Pony Club, Victoria: $30,000 Vaucluse Sailing Club, NSW: $50,000  Bayview Golf Club, Mona Vale: $140,000 Northbridge Sailing Club, NSW: $75,000  Hawthorn Hockey Centre, Victoria: $500,000  St George Sailing Club, NSW: $200,000 Alexander Park Dressage Club, NSW: $60,000   Ballina Tennis Club, NSW: $60,000 It boasts of enjoying a 'recently built state of the art clubhouse' complete with a 'stylish members lounge, restaurant and bar'.  Meanwhile, the likes of Cumberland Council, home to Sydney's poorest suburb Yennora, received a pitiful $35,075 in two small grants.  This is in stark contrast to the lavish $500,000 gifted to Mosman Rowing Club, in one of Sydney's richest areas, so it can extend its pontoon. While families in Yennora struggle to get by on a median income of just $19,000, Mosman residents enjoy $73,820 on average.  A similarly exclusive boat club, the Vaucluse Sailing Club, was given $50,000 to buy, among other things, new lighting. The Byron Bay Cycling Club - a favourite with affluent businessmen wearing lycra - also benefited to the tune of $230,000.  The Main Ridge Pony Club in the picturesque Melbourne suburb of Mornington Peninsula - located in the electorate of health minister Greg Hunt - also raked in $30,000.  The nearby Mordialloc Sailing Club also walked away with $15,000. Melbourne's most affluent suburb, Camberwell, also did remarkably well from the controversial handouts. The East Camberwell Tennis Club got $90,000, the Camberwell Junior Football Club received $10,520, the South Camberwell Tennis Club was handed $15,000 and the Camberwell Hockey Club raked in $38,000. Northbridge Sailing Club, in Sydney's affluent Middle Harbour, was also gifted a huge $75,000 grant. In contrast, the council for the Melbourne suburb of Wyndham, known for incredibly high levels of illness and poverty, didn't receive a cent. Likewise, the working class Coledale Waves soccer club, used by 1,200 players a week, was left with nothing. Despite having no women's changing room, poor lighting and unsuitable playing surfaces, the club's application was rejected in favour of pony clubs and yacht facilities.    One of the coaches said their detailed application to the scheme took more than 100 painstaking hours.  'Because of our increased playing numbers, we need to radically improve our facilities and infrastructure,' coach Martin Smith told ABC. 'We were aware of the criteria and felt we had a very strong case for matching the criteria. 'We weren't aware the minister's discretion might come into play.' Brothers Rugby Club in Queensland, one of Australia's most prestigious rugby institutions, also received a whopping $500,000 of taxpayers' money.  A damning report  has found Senator McKenzie, the then-sports minister, approved hundreds of sporting clubs applications for the grants because they were in marginal seats during the last election. She even approved the windfall for a clay shooting club at Wangaratta, of which she is a member. Prime Minister Scott Morrrison has since launched an investigation to establish whether Ms McKenzie, who is under growing pressure to resign, breached ministerial standards.  The elite Mosman Rowing Club is in Tony Abbot's former seat of Warringhah, while Vaucluse is home to MP Dave Sharma, who risked losing his seat.  ACT 13 recipients, total of $1,575,405 NSW 176 recipients, total of $23,962,009  NT 11 recipients, total of $2,853,921 TAS 24 recipients, total of $3,136,887 WA 102 recipients, total of $11,334,312 VIC 176 recipients, total of $25,236,643 QLD 117 recipients, total of $21,067,948 SA 65 recipients, total of $11,105,727  Similarly, the Hawthorn Hockey Centre in the affluent Melbourne suburb also received an eye-watering $500,000 grant for a new pavillion. Similarly, its MP Josh Frydenberg was also able to retain his seat at the last election. The same can be said for Queensland MP George Christensen, who retained his seat after his local Mackay Football Club won $491,260 for an upgrade. A $200,000 grant was also gifted to a Como rowing club near Scott Morrison's home in Sutherland Shire.  St George Rowing Club even holds lavish weddings on its roof.  Opposition leader Anthony Albanese said Senator McKenzie's behaviour was a disgrace and she should resign.   'This is just red hot. This is just a rort,' he said. 'It fails the pub test - it fails every test. 'This goes to the fundamental integrity and faith in politics.'  Auditor-General Grant Hehir was scathing of the way she distributed 684 grants in December 2018, as well as in February and April 2019 during her final months as sports minister before the last election. The funds went either into Coalition electorates or marginal seats the government was hoping to win. 'The award of grant funding was not informed by an appropriate assessment process and sound advice,' the Australian National Audit Office report said. 'The successful applications were not those that had been assessed as the most meritorious in terms of the published program guidelines.' 2018: A member of Ms McKenzie's staff warns her that targeting Coalition seats with $100 million in sports grants could lead to a 'scandal'. In an effort to 'cover their a***s', her department increases the funding to sporting clubs in Labor-held seats from 24 per cent to 36 per cent. 2019: January 15 Auditor-general report released into $100 million Community Sport Infrastructure Program. Two main conclusions: 'the award of grant funding was not informed by an appropriate assessment process and sound advice; the successful applications were not those that had been assessed as the most meritorious in terms of the published program guidelines'. January 16 Former sports minister Bridget McKenzie says no rules were broken. 'The reality was there were many hundreds of meritorious projects that we just didn't have the funding available for,' she said. Labor says Ms McKenzie, who is now in cabinet as agriculture minister, should be sacked or resign January 17 Prime Minister Scott Morrison refers issue to his department chief, but does not make this publicly known  Minor parties say they will back a Senate inquiry into the matter, when parliament resumes on February 4 January 18 Law firm Slater and Gordon says a class action is possible as tens of millions of dollars in sporting club grants were awarded to clubs whose applications for funding would otherwise have been unsuccessful January 20 Mr Morrison says in interviews he is taking the auditor report seriously and that he's tasked the attorney-general with looking at legal issues raised in it January 21 Labor wants the details published of all grant applications and their assessment scores Law academic Professor Anne Twomey questioned whether the constitution was breached as the federal government has no power to hand out money to sports clubs January 22 Prime minister publicly reveals he sought an inquiry by his department chief  Media reports say Ms McKenzie was a member of a gun club which received a grant. The membership was not declared by the minister. Her office says the membership was a gift and did not need declaring. February 2 Bridget McKenzie resigns
