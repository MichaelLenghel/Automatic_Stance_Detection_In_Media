Canberra United will part ways with coach Heather Garriock at the end of the W-League season. Capital Football confirmed on Thursday it would not renew Garriock's contract beyond this campaign. "Heather has played a significant role in developing young players through the pathway system, including the Canberra United Academy through to Canberra United," Capital Football chief executive Phil Brown said in a statement. "We will be indebted to Heather for the role she has played in establishing high performance standards within the program." Canberra started this season strongly, winning two of their first three games. But Garriock's side is in the midst of a four-game losing streak, conceding 15 goals in that time, and will fall short of finals. Sixth on the table, Canberra are seven points behind fourth-placed Melbourne Victory with two games remaining Canberra have failed to make the finals during Garriock's three years at the helm. "I am grateful for the opportunity given to me by Capital Football to coach at this level," Garriock said. "As somebody who has been involved in elite sport for most of my life, I fully understand the decision that has been made by the organisation. "I am proud of the role I have played in nurturing young players and developing them, not only as footballers, but also as people. "I have enjoyed contributing to the lives on and off the field of every player who has pulled on a Canberra United jersey." Garriock was the only female head coach in the W-League season this year, though Ashley Wilson has taken the reins at Newcastle since Craig Deans became the Jets' A-League caretaker coach.
