Boris Becker has backed Andy Murray to return from his latest injury nightmare and reclaim his place at the top of his sport. Murray is on the shortlist in the Comeback of the Year category at Monday night's Laureus Sports Awards in Berlin after returning from career-threatening hip surgery.  The Scot faces a fresh fight for fitness after being ruled out since November with a pelvic problem, but Becker believes he can achieve what few other players could manage. Becker said: 'Most players would have retired after a serious hip injury like that. If you'd asked me last year, I didn't think he would be here. But Andy being Andy, he did come back and he played wonderfully in the second half of last year. Andy never had the most power or the most talent, but he always had great determination and willpower that sets him apart.' Murray faces competition from Liverpool in the Comeback category, after their recovery from a three-goal deficit to beat Barcelona last season. F1 champion Lewis Hamilton is nominated for Sportsman of the Year while swimmer Alice Tai is on the shortlist for Sportsperson of the Year with a Disability.
