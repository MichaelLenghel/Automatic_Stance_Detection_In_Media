Arsenal have identified Jonathan Tah as their top defensive target, but the Premier League club must act quick to activate his £40m release clause.  According to Sport Bild, the Gunners want the Bayer Leverkusen centre back to strengthen their squad this summer and have made him their No 1 priority. They also claim that the 24-year-old has a release clause, but it will expire in June. His current deal runs until 2023.  Tah has made 18 appearances for Leverkusen in the top flight this season. He also has nine Germany caps to his name.  Arsenal brought in defensive reinforcements in January, with Pablo Mari arriving on an initial loan deal from Flamengo. The north London club have the option to make the move permanent.
