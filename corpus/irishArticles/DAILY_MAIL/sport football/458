Cardiff City have paid tribute to Emiliano Sala on the first anniversary of his death by including him in the squad on the back of the programme for the FA Cup clash with Reading.  Sala died in a plane crash in January 2019 as he flew to Cardiff to complete his £15million move to the club from Nantes.  Twelve months on from his tragic death, the football world has paid tribute to the striker, with Cardiff following suit by naming him alongside a daffodil in their squad list. The tribute follows a cathedral memorial service held in his honour on Wednesday, which was attended by fans, players and staff.  Sala's former club Nantes also unveiled a special Argentinian-themed kit they will wear during their clash with Bordeaux on Sunday. However, the Bluebirds have been embroiled in a dispute with Nantes over the £15m fee they agreed to pay the Ligue 1 club for the striker.  Cardiff have argued that they shouldn't have to pay any of the fee as the Argentinian never signed the final version of his contract - a stance Nantes have strongly rejected.  FIFA ruled in September that Cardiff would have to pay the full sum, but the Welsh club have appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in a bid to overturn the verdict. A hearing is set to get underway in Switzerland in spring and a final ruling is expected by June. Cardiff were due to make pay their first instalment for the striker last year and the second this month. If they fail in their appeal, the club could face a three-window transfer ban.
