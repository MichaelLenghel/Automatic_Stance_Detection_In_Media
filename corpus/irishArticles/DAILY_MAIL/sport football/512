Former Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri is happy to wait for the right job to became available rather than rush back into football, according to his agent. Allegri has been linked with the Manchester United vacancy and Sportsmail reported earlier in January that he is holding out to see if Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is axed as manager at Old Trafford. According to his agent, Giovanni Branchini, Allegri is not necessarily just preparing for life in England. 'I don't think Allegri will return particularly soon. He says he's intensifying his English lessons, but I am not so sure about that,' Branchini told Radio Anch'io Sport. 'Jokes aside, he is happy to have a year off. Sometimes you need to stop and see things from a different angle.  'I am certain that from next season he'll be happy to resume his professional journey.' Branchini said that Allegri is open to taking a job outside of Italy.  'It’s difficult to make predictions, as so much depends on how some clubs do in the Champions League. At this moment, it’d be really just baseless speculation.'
