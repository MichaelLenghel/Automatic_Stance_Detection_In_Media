Former RB Leipzig manager Ralf Rangnick has reportedly signed a pre-contract with AC Milan to take charge of the Serie A club next season.  Rangnick, who is currently in a role as 'Head of Sport and Development' within the Red Bull organisation, had two spells at Leipzig but left last summer, with Julian Nagelsmann replacing him.  But it looks like 61-year-old Rangnick is ready to dip his toes back into management at Milan and he will have full control over transfers, scouting and coaching, according to French outlet L'Equipe. The report details that with all three roles being effectively occupied by Rangnick, Paolo Maldini and Zvonimir Boban's — technical director and chief football officer respectively — time at the club would come to an end. In addition, a clause is believed to have been agreed saying that if Milan's ownership goes back on the full terms of deal, Rangnick will be entitled to financial compensation.  Current Milan manager Stefano Pioli is not expected to last beyond the end of the season.  Pioli only came in four months ago, after Marco Giampaolo was sacked at the beginning of October.   Milan are currently eighth in the Serie A table, and last week lost the city derby to rivals Inter 4-2, having been two goals up.  Rangnick, meanwhile, has had spells at Hannover, Hoffenheim and two stints in charge at Schalke, as well as his involvement with Red Bull.
