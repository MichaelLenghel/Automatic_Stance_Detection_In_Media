Barcelona midfielder Ivan Rakitic has 'decided to stay at Barcelona and fight for his place rather than leave the club before the transfer window shuts'. That's the view of Spanish publication Diario Sport who claim that the 31-year-old isn't going anywhere. Speculation over Rakitic's future has been rife with Manchester United, Inter Milan and Juventus all interested in his services in the summer. The Croatia international has seen his minutes reduced as he competes for a spot in midfield with the likes of Sergio Busquets, Arthur and Frenkie de Jong. The midfielder has made 23 appearances for Barcelona this season so far in all competitions but he is determined to see the campaign out at the Nou Camp. His contract with Barcelona runs out in June 2021, having signed an extension back in 2017.
