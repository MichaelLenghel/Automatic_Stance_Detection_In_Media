Arsenal are reportedly considering a move for Bayer Leverkusen defender Jonathan Tah, with his £34million release clause set to expire in June.  Gunners boss Mikel Arteta has made defensive reinforcements a priority this summer as he looks to restore the club to the top four after difficulties in recent seasons.  While RB Leipzig's Dayot Upamecano is of interest, Sport Bild report that Arsenal are now debating whether to activate Tah's release clause for some early transfer business this summer.    While Arteta has overseen improvement defensively since succeeding Unai Emery as manager, he is under no illusions that he has to strengthen before next season.  David Luiz and Shkodran Mustafi have flattered to deceive at times and a move for another central defender is widely expected to be a priority.   German international Tah has gone on to make more than 150 appearances for Leverkusen and has been part of the national team set-up since 2016.   Atletico Madrid have also been credited with an interest in Tah and both will be aware that his £34m release clause expires in June so a swift decision over any move is vital.  Tah's Bundesliga rival Upamecano has long been touted as the defender that will cause a frenzy this summer and he made it clear prior to the Champions League win over Tottenham that he will assess his future come the summer.  'There are several clubs that want me,' he said. 'I will speak with my agents and my parents at the end of the season and we will make the right decision.'
