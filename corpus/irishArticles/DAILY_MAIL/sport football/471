Olivia Munn shares several behind-the-scenes shots for a new photo shoot. The Newsroom actress showed off her slender figure in a plunging silver one-piece swimsuit as she laid back on a white pool raft while in a large infinity swimming pool. The 39-year-old ex-girlfriend of football player Aaron Rodgers was also seen in an orange two-piece suit. The star is very into yoga and martial arts, she has said in the past. And she often uses a personal trainer.  Olivia developed a love of martial arts while filming X-Men. The actress had to train in Taekwondo and follow a strict diet which consisted of 80 per cent raw foods, limited complex carbs and meat. Olivia recently spoke about how she maintains her figure through the sport in Women's Health: 'When you do martial arts, it makes you feel like you’re physically capable of anything,' she said. 'And the great side effect is that when you’re in your best shape, you actually will look your best too. 'As much as I care about looking and feeling my best, it’s not enough of a motivation for me, I need a goal of accomplishing something.' The star has been dating Tucker Roberts, 28. They were seen together in November as he accompanied her to Love Leo Rescue's second annual Cocktails For A Cause charity fundraiser at Rolling Greens in Los Angeles. The couple went public with their relationship in December 2018, but have only attended a handful of events together over the past year. Tucker is Olivia's first serious relationship since she split from NFL player Aaron Rodgers, 35, in 2017 after three years together. Olivia previously said she doesn't know if she'll ever want to get married and have children.
