The over-55s are showing no sign of slowing down and are spending more time getting fit, a new report reveals. While some age groups are taking less exercise, pensioners and the middle-aged are actually becoming more active, according to Age UK. Exercise levels among those aged 55 to 74 are up 3.4 per cent since 2015/16, and those over 75 are doing 4.7 per cent more.  The figures – taken from Sport England's Active Lives Adult Survey – suggest older people are spending more time getting fit, while younger groups' activity levels have either fallen or plateaued. Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said: 'Even small amounts of physical activity can make a difference to a person's health, lowering the risk of developing serious conditions such as heart disease, stroke, and certain cancers. 'Along with lowering risks of dementia and maintaining thinking skills in later life, performing exercises that improve muscle strength can also reduce the risk of falls by improving posture, coordination and balance. 'Often older people feel that regular physical activity is not for them but even people who are immobile or unwell can feel the benefit.  'We don't expect everyone to run the marathon and it's not appropriate that they do, simply doing some stretching exercises while sitting in a chair is a help. 'It doesn't matter whether you're aged 25 or 85, it's never too late to take small steps towards moving more on a daily basis and maintaining those levels throughout the year.'
