Conor McGregor may be set for a sensational return to the boxing ring to face another great of the sport, after Filipino icon Manny Pacquiao put pen to paper on a deal which could accelerate the whole process. McGregor has been widely tipped for a return to boxing since his first foray into the sport in August 2017 against Floyd Mayweather. The clash went down as one of the most lucrative in boxing history, and now Pacquiao is said to be keen for a slice of the action. The 41-year-old has this week signed a deal with McGregor's management company, Paradigm Sports. Paradigm have pledged to take care of Pacquiao's 'commercial and competitive endeavours', meaning a blockbuster meeting with McGregor is now high up on the list of priorities. After announcing the Filipino's arrival, Paradigm took to social media to broadcast their latest recruit.  Acknowledging the arrival, McGregor wrote: 'Welcome to the team Emmanuel.' 'I am proud to partner with Paradigm Sports Management and am excited for the opportunities that Audie Attar and PSM have to offer,' Pacquiao said in a release following the news.  'One thing I want everyone to remember is to always think positively. Never think negatively; that is the beginning of your downfall. Everything is possible.' Pacquiao last took to the ring in July 2019, when he faced American Kieth Thurman and took victory by split decision. McGregor meanwhile recently made his return to the UFC, beating Donald 'Cowboy' Cerrone last month in ruthless fashion with a 60-second KO.
