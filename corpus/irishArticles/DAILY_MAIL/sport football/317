Footballer Shane Long has as many points on his driving licence as Premier League goals in the last two seasons after he was caught speeding in his Porsche. The Southampton striker, 33, was caught travelling at 101mph on a busy motorway in his £120,000 Panamera Turbo Sport Turismo. The Irish international, thought to be on a weekly salary of £60,000 at Saints, must now pay a fine of £440. Aldershot Magistrates Court heard that Long drove at 101mph along the M27 motorway in Southampton, Hampshire. His speeding offence took place on October 20 2019, a day after his team drew one all away at Wolves. Long, who lives in a £1.4million home in the village of West Wellow, near Southampton, had six points slapped on his licence. It means the forward now has as many points on his licence as he does Premier League goals in the last two seasons.  So far this season he has scored just once in the league. He scored the fastest goal in Premier League history in April after just seven seconds against Watford breaking a 19-year record held by Tottenham defender Ledley King.  Long admitted speeding but did not appear at Aldershot Magistrates' Court under the Single Justice Procedure guidelines. He must also pay a victim surcharge of £44 and costs of £85.
