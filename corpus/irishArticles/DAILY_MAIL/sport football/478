Emre Can has reportedly told Borussia Dortmund he is interested in joining them, but the German club are still negotiating with Juventus about the fee, according to Football Italia.  Reports earlier in the week claimed that Juventus are looking for between £21million and £25m for the midfielder. They are willing to part with Can, but are thought to be holding out for the full amount.  Can wants to leave this month so he can get regular minutes amid concerns he could lose his place in Germany's squad for this summer's European Championship. He appears eager to join Dortmund, with Sport Italia journalist Alfredo Pedulla writing that he has said 'yes' to the transfer.  The 26-year-old has made just eight appearances for Juventus in all competitions this season. He joined from Liverpool on a free transfer in 2018, and his current contract runs until June 2022.  Juventus are leading the way in Serie A, will Dortmund are currently fourth in the German Bundesliga.    Can has also been linked with a move to Manchester United, Everton, AC Milan and Tottenham in recent weeks.
