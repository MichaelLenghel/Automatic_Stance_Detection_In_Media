Javier Mascherano wants Lionel Messi to end his football career back home in Argentina. The former Barcelona star, 35, has this month returned to his homeland with Estudiantes - 15 years after leaving River Plate. And he believes that his former club and international team-mate could follow his route back to South America. 'Anything can happen in the world of football and it depends on his desire to play in Argentina', he is quoted as saying in Sport. 'There's also the family aspect when he decides to live over here. These are personal issues and no one else can influence them.  'If he decides to come here in the future, it'd be a huge jump in quality for our league and the country.'
