He's not known for being a bad sport, but tennis ace Novak Djokovic flipped a table at comedian Andy Lee out of frustration on Monday. The pair were playing a variant of the children's game Guess Who? for a segment on Nine's Wide World of Sport when Novak lost to the funnyman. The Serbian, 32, flipped the table in anger after incorrectly guessing his rival Roger Federer in the game, which for copyright reasons was called 'Guess Whom?' Guess Whom? involved the players attempting to guess their opponent's character based on a series of yes-or-no questions.  The 38-year-old radio host had actually been given the Novak Djokovic card, but threw the real Novak off the scent by saying his character was 'calm'.  Novak soon proved otherwise after the correct answer was revealed, as he stood up and flipped the table over.  'I did think you were pretty calm,' Andy said as he revealed his card.  In a sudden burst of anger, Novak tossed the table aside, yelling: 'What do you mean calm?!' He then stormed off the set, leaving Andy looking shocked - but it was of course just part of a comedy skit for the Nine program. In the lead-up to the staged 'meltdown', the two men were playing amicably.  Novak had been given the card of Australian women's tennis player Samantha Stosur, whom he described as not 'stylish enough for a high end clothing brand to want to use [her] as the face of it'. Coverage of the Australian Open continues on Channel Nine.
