One of Jadon Sancho's first coaches has recalled what the Borussia Dortmund star was like as a child.  Sayce Holmes-Lewis was immediately struck by the Englishman's ability in multiple sports and is not surprised by the new heights Sancho continues to reach.   'He was excellent at school, really. I had him during sports too, and he was brilliant in cricket, flag rugby, in athletics and basketball,' he told France Football.  'But his real love was obviously football. And when he didn't win, he sulked. You always had to be better, both in training and in matches.'  The winger is set to take on PSG in the first leg of Borussia Dortmund's Champions League last 16 tie on Tuesday night and his rise has been remarkable.  He has earned international honours and been linked with a big money move back to the Premier League in the summer.  It has been a long journey to this point and Holmes-Lewis was there at it's genesis.  'I saw him for the first time when he was at Watford, when he was six. He was already an excellent player. I was dazzled by his technique and his skills.  'Above all, he played with a smile on his face. He always played a lot of football, with the game in his life, like Reiss Nelson, his best friend.' Nelson is another youngster who spent time in the Bundesliga, on loan from Arsenal, and Holmes-Lewis described the 20-year-old and Sancho as 'like brothers'.    Given Sancho's flair and ability on the ball, there could be a perception of over-confidence but Holmes-Lewis reflected that the boy he knew was always humble and shy.  He has been arguably Dortmund's best player this season so far with 16 goals and 14 assists in all competitions.  The 19-year-old will be looking to add to those stats in the huge game against PSG on Tuesday evening.
