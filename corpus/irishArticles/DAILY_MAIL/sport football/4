Zlatan Ibrahimovic could remain at AC Milan even if the club don't qualify for the Champions League next season. The Swedish striker, 38, has an automatic renewal option in his six-month contract with the San Siro club in case of qualification for Europe's elite club competition. But Italian newspaper Tuttosport report, as relayed by Football Italia, that Ibrahimovic is open to staying anyway regardless of where Milan finish in the table. Milan are currently nine points adrift of Atalanta, who occupy the fourth Champions League place in Serie A. But they have won six matches and lost only once in Serie A and the Coppa Italia since Ibrahimovic returned to his former club on December 27. The veteran has scored three goals since returning to Milan and directors Paolo Maldini and Zvonimir Boban plan talks with Ibrahimovic over staying next season. Indeed it was technical director Maldini who revealed over the weekend that Ibrahimovic has the renewal clause in his contract. He told Sky Sport Italia: 'There's a six-month contract with an automatic renewal clause in case we reach the Champions League. 'Otherwise, we'll put ourselves round the table with him. With Ibra, there must always be an open dialogue and this exists, otherwise he would not have come in the first place.' Ibrahimovic scored 42 goals in 61 games for Milan between 2010 and 2012, with the club's hierarchy signing him again to try and turn around Milan's faltering season. Milan have not competed in Europe's most prestigious club competition since they were knocked out at the round-of-16 stage by Atletico Madrid in 2014, although Ibrahmovic helped them to reach the quarter-finals in 2012, when they were eliminated by Barcelona.
