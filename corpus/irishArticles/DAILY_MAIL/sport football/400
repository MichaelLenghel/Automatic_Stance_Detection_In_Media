Ivan Rakitic's future at Barcelona remains in doubt with the club open to selling him before the January transfer window closes. That's the view of Spanish publication Sport, who claim that Barcelona are not against the idea of losing the Croatia international midway through this season. Rakitic wishes to remain at the Nou Camp, but the Catalan giants believe he would reconsider his position if a big club made a move for him. The 31-year-old was the subject of interest from Manchester United, Inter Milan and Juventus in the summer - with the latter having good relations with Barca. Sport, via El Larguero on SER, add that talks between Juve and Barca over Rakitic have been reignited following the deal this weekend that saw Alejandro Marques move to Turin and Matheus Pereira join Barca B. The midfielder has made 22 appearances for Barcelona this season so far in all competitions. His contract with Barcelona runs out in June 2021, having signed an extension back in 2017.
