Micah Richards has defended Manchester City after his former club were handed a ban from European football from UEFA which sees the club's future grow uncertain.  The Premier League champions discovered last Friday that they would miss the next two Champions League competitions after the football governing body found the club had breached Financial Fair Play rules.  City have expressed their intention to appeal the ruling, with the case being taken to the Court of Arbitration for Sport with club chiefs hoping to have the decision overturned.  And Richards, who spent ten years with City from 2005 to 2015, has launched a staunch defence of his former club over the ruling.  'At times it does feel like the world is against us. The money Sheikh Mansour has invested, ever since it has come in it is like we have become the new Manchester United,' he said on Sky Sports.  'We have tried to be humble with the money spent at City but at times it does feel like everyone is against us.' Following the UEFA decision, question marks hang over the futures of some of City's star players as well as manager Pep Guardiola.  The Spaniard has reportedly told his players that he will stick by the club and has challenged them to prove they are talent, not money. Richards said Guardiola's side won't be distracted by the off-field trouble.   'I don’t think it will be too hard to focus,' he added. 'Obviously it's a two-year ban but straight away City came out and said they would appeal that.  'These players are strong enough, they have the character, and they know they have to do their work on the pitch. Don’t think about things off the pitch, City are contesting it and they have every right to.'
