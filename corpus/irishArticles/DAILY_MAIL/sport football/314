The New York Red Bulls named Kevin Thelwell as the club's head of sport, hoping the former Wolverhampton Wanderers FC sporting director can work his magic in MLS as well. This is a newly created position with the Red Bulls. After joining Wolverhampton in a front-office role, Thelwell, 46, helped guide the club from the third tier in England to winners of the second tier in 2017-18 and a promotion to the English Premier League. The Wolves finished in seventh place in the Premier League last season and are in eighth place in 2019-20. "I am both honored and excited to join the New York Red Bulls," Thelwell said. "When this opportunity presented itself, I was given the chance to meet people within the organization to learn more about the club and soon realized that this was the right place for me. I look forward to the opportunity to work in Major League Soccer and continue the club's pursuit of competing for MLS Cup." Thelwell will oversee all aspects of the on-field product for the Red Bulls. Denis Hamlett will remain sporting director and report to Thelwell. --Field Level Media
