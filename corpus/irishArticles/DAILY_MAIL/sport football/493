Borussia Dortmund are reportedly in talks with Juventus to sign Emre Can permanently this month.   La Gazzetta dello Sport claim Can could join Dortmund if the two clubs can reach an agreement on a fee. The report claims that Juventus are looking for between £21million and £25m for the midfielder. Can wants to leave this month so he can get regular minutes amid concerns he could lose his place in Germany's squad for this summer's European Championship.  The 26-year-old has made just eight appearances for Juventus in all competitions this season. Can has also been linked with a move to Manchester United, Everton, AC Milan and Tottenham.
