Police in Birmingham, Ala., are investigating the death of former Mississippi State wide receiver De'Runnya Wilson as a homicide. Wilson, 25, was found dead on Tuesday in a home in the city after police received a call about an unresponsive person. Sgt. Johnny Williams of the Birmingham Police Department said he had only "limited details on the investigation" but that police were seeking people in the area with "additional information as to what may have occurred during this homicide." Wilson, who attended high school in Birmingham, played for Mississippi State from 2013-15 and was a favorite target of quarterback Dak Prescott. In three seasons with the Bulldogs, Wilson had 133 catches for 1,936 receiving yards and 22 touchdowns. He is No. 6 in receptions on the Bulldogs' all-time list and tied for second in touchdown receptions. He caught 19 touchdown passes from Prescott, making them the No. 1 quarterback-to-receiver TD duo ever for the Bulldogs. In 2015, he caught 60 passes for 918 yards, placing him seventh in receiving yards for a season in Mississippi State history. Alabama's Mr. Basketball in 2013, he started his Mississippi State career as a two-sport athlete, appearing in seven basketball games before deciding to concentrate on football. Wilson left Mississippi State after three seasons to enter the 2016 NFL Draft but wasn't selected. He worked out for the Chicago Bears in 2016. --Field Level Media
