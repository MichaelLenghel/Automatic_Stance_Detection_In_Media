Jurgen Klopp won't be the only one not turning up at Liverpool versus Shrewsbury – neither will the TV cameras.  Sportsmail understands plans to hold the fixture on Wednesday rather than Tuesday have fallen through. The BBC are showing the Newcastle v Oxford United FA Cup replay that night and an attempt by BT Sport to show the Anfield clash at the same time is understood to have been unsuccessful. Instead, they will screen the Spurs against Southampton rematch. Following Sunday’s 2-2 draw at the New Meadow, Klopp controversially said none of his first-team squad would be involved in next week's game, which comes in the middle of the first week of Liverpool's winter break. He also said that he would not be present at the game. Speaking ahead of Wednesday night's Premier League game against West Ham, where Klopp's side will look to go 19 points clear at the top of the table, he insisted he will not even be in the directors' box against the Shrews. Under-23 boss Neil Critchley will take charge of the team. The club have cut ticket prices for the FA Cup game to £15 for adults, £5 for young adults and £1 for children. But that will impact on Shrewsbury, who get 45 per cent of the gate receipts.
