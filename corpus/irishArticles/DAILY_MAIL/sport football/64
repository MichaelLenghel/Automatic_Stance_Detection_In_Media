Bayern Munich goalkeeper Christian Fruchtl reportedly turned down the chance to join Liverpool in December. The 20-year-old was keen to secure a loan move away from the Allianz Arena in a bid to gain regular game time.  The Reds got in contact with Bayern to ask about the keeper's availability before the end of 2019, promising that Fruchtl would be their No 2 behind Alisson should he join them in the transfer window. But according to Sport 1, the keeper turned down the offer as he only wanted to join a club where he would be the guaranteed first-choice. The German ended up staying with Bayern as a result although the report claims he still wants a loan move next season with his future remaining open. The youngster is currently behind Manuel Neuer and Sven Ulreich but with Alexander Nubel agreeing to join the club in the summer, Fruchtl is likely to be pushed even further down the pecking order. The keeper has played regularly in Bayern's third division team but has not made a senior appearance this season. Adrian has been Liverpool's second-choice keeper since he joined from West Ham in August and has proved to be a safe pair of hands on the occasions when Alisson has been injured or suspended. Caoimhin Kelleher is behind the Spaniard and was used in the Reds' Carabao Cup fixtures.
