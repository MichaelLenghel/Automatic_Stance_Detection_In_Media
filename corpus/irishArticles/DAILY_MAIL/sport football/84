Manchester United weren't the only side left ruing the missed opportunity to sign Erling Haaland following the 19-year-old's sensational brace against Paris Saint Germain in the Champions League. The Borussia Dortmund striker has settled into his new surroundings with ease since sealing his £17million switch from Red Bull Salzburg last month, having netted eleven times in seven appearances for the German club. The Norwegian hitman has seen his stock rise dramatically over the past 12 months, with United among a number of top European clubs interested in the son of Alf-Inge, who played for Manchester City. And, had events transpired differently, Haaland could have been a Roma player had the Italian club not turned down the chance to sign him two years ago. Roma chief Sebino Nela has revealed that Haaland, who was 17 at the time, had been brought to the attention of former sporting director Monchi, with the club offered the chance to sign him at a cut price deal of £3.3million. 'Roma were offered the chance to sign Erling Haaland two years ago for €4m,' Nela told Radio Centro Suono Sport. 'He was proposed to Monchi by a former Roma player, but the club turned him down, so he went to Salzburg instead.' Haaland went on to score 29 goals in 27 appearances for the Austrian club before moving to Germany in January. Since moving to Dortmund, the 19-year-old has netted a goal every 39 minutes for Lucien Favre's side.  The Norwegian's double gives Dortmund a good chance of progressing to the quarter finals of the competition ahead of their second leg with the French giants next month.
