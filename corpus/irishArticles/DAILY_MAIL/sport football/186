England captain and Tottenham striker Harry Kane has thrown his weight behind Sportsmail's campaign to recognise Jimmy Greaves with an honour. Kane was among those to back our petition on social media on Thursday and numbers soared with more than 8,000 people signing up inside the first two days.  Ex-Spurs star and Sportsmail columnist Peter Crouch and Arsenal fan and TV presenter Piers Morgan were among others to offer support.  'A great campaign for a true goalscoring legend,' said Kane as he circulated a link to the online petition to his 2.8million followers on Twitter. Morgan tweeted: 'It's an absolute travesty that Jimmy Greaves has never been honoured for his outstanding services to football and broadcasting. Please support this great campaign and sign the petition.'  Sportsmail launched the campaign to 'Get Greavsie a Gong' and hundreds of our readers have sent in letters and emails to share their thoughts.  'The response has been overwhelming,' said Jimmy's son Danny.  Greaves, who suffered a severe stroke five years ago, will be 80 on Thursday and a new film about his life will be shown for the first time on BT Sport on Tuesday.
