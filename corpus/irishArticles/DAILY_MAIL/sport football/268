Vintage posters with designs linked to winter travel and winter sports are set to sell for thousands of pounds at auction.  The rare posters, which date back to the 1920s, are due to go under the hammer at Swann Auction Galleries in New York on February 13 as part of its wider Vintage Posters sale.  Some of the posters encourage travel to destinations like Norway and Vancouver. Others advertise winter events including the Olympic Games. A few even advertise products, including a poster that promotes the Bensdorp brand of cocoa as an ideal pre-trip tipple.  While there are a few relative bargains in the lot with price tags of between $400 (£309) to $600 (£463), most of the artworks are set to sell for upwards of £1,000. Scroll down to see some of the lots on offer in the sale...
