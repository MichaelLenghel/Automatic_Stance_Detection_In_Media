Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson and former Reds skipper Steven Gerrard are among a number of football stars supporting shirt donations after the death of a non-League footballer. Jordan Sinnott, who played for Matlock Town, died on Saturday after being attacked in two mass brawls in Retford, Nottinghamshire. The 25-year-old started his career at Huddersfield and also played for Halifax as well as Alfreton before moving to Matlock last summer. Jordan's brother, Tom, had explained on social media that his family were looking for shirts with 'Sinnott 25' on the back to be donated. The shirts will be on display at Sinnott's funeral before being donated to Sport Relief in a bid to help raise money for under-privileged children. There has been a high response with Henderson and Gerrard just two of the many of players and clubs who have put a shirt in the post. The Twitter account Shirts for Jordan has been retweeting every donation post since the appeal was made on Monday. From Brighton to Grimsby, clubs up and down the football pyramid have got involved. Tom Sinnott said: 'It is overwhelming. It just means the world to me to know Jord, even after he passed, is still bringing joy to people even if he didn't know them.'  'Out of everyone, he was the best person I ever knew.' Sinnott was found with a fractured skull in the early hours of Saturday morning and died in hospital at 6pm on the same day. Three arrested men aged 21 remain in custody, while a 20-year-old man was released without charge.
