Manchester City star Bernardo Silva admits he feels an 'emptiness' after leaving Benfica 'a little early' and has hinted he wants to play for the Portuguese club later in his career. The 25-year-old midfielder left the Estadio da Luz after just three first-team appearances to sign for Monaco in August 2014. After impressing in France, Portugal international Silva moved to Manchester City for £43.5million in the summer of 2017. He has since become a key part of Pep Guardiola's side, winning back-to-back Premier League titles as well as the FA Cup and two League Cups. But Silva says he has a yearning to return to Benfica, where he emerged from the academy ranks, later in his career. 'I have already said it several times: I have this emptiness of having left a little early, so I think I will come back,' he told Eleven Sports as reported by Record. 'If they want me there, I think I will come back.' Silva has contributed seven goals and seven assists in 34 matches for City this season but turbulent times await the club. UEFA's Club Financial Control Body announced on Friday that City will be banned from the Champions League for two seasons after breaching Financial Fair Play regulations. The club plan to appeal the decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sport but the verdict has raised question marks over the future of key players including Kevin de Bruyne and Raheem Sterling, as well as manager Pep Guardiola. Silva made his comments prior to the news breaking on Friday.
