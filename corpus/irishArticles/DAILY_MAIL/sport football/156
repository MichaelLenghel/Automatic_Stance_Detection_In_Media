Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis has admitted he is considering suing referees for damages in the future if they refuse to use the VAR monitors.  The Serie A side were involved in a controversial incident during their 3-2 defeat by Lecce last weekend when the referee booked Arkadiusz Milik for simulation after he went down in the penalty box. But the referee then seemingly refused to watch it back despite encouragement to do so from the VAR booth. Had he checked the monitor, he would have seen the Poland striker's ankle had been caught. The Italian authorities have suggested introducing a tennis-style VAR challenge, where coaches are allowed to request limited on-field reviews. But for the time being De Laurentiis has maintained referees may not escape his financial wrath nor a sense of accountability if they refuse to consult the technology at hand when prompted to do so. De Laurentiis told Corriere dello Sport: 'I always maintained that any system of assistance that is intermittent or optional is inconceivable. It must be obligatory. 'If a referee, either through incompetence or arrogance, does not use VAR, he is committing a sporting crime, because he compromises the result. 'Football is not just a game. It is also an industry that produces very significant economic results. 'Why not? The principle of 'you pay for mistakes' aids all democratic processes and football is no different. If a judge emits the wrong sentence, he can be called to repay damages. Should a referee not be held to the same rules? 'Napoli have been denied numerous penalties this season. It's not just me saying that, but recognised throughout the media.  'If this chain reaction of errors should turn into a financial loss of €200m, who would pay us back for that?'
