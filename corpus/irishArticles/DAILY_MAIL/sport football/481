Manchester United legend Paul Ince has criticised the club for rushing their appointment of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer last season. Solskjaer was appointed Jose Mourinho's successor in March 2019 after winning 14 of his first 19 games in charge of the club. Since then United have suffered a dramatic dip in form, despite the summer signings of Harry Maguire, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Daniel James.  Wednesday's 2-0 defeat to Burnley at Old Trafford prompted critics to suggest Solskjaer's time at the club was coming to an end and Ince says he isn't the only high profile figure who should depart. 'I said at the start and I say again, too many people got sucked into how well he did at the start winning 14 out of 19 games that he was the man for the job,' he told BT Sport.  'He was the interim manager, there was plenty of time to wait until the end of the season, do their research, see who was out there but they got sucked into it. The crowd got sucked into it and so did the owners.  'You are talking about a manager who took Cardiff down, went to Molde… his CV is not great from that point of view. I want Ole to do well because if Ole does well United do well.  'But they haven’t done their homework and that comes down to Ed Woodward and maybe he should be the one who steps back and someone else comes in who knows about the football game.' Ince also admitted he'd been left surprised by United's decision not to hire a sporting director like many of Europe's top clubs. 'Listen, we talk about Liverpool and I said to Crouchy before about Michael Edwards at Liverpool, football director.  'Most of the clubs in the Premier League have a football director, it is the way other clubs have always been. But for some reason United have decided we don’t need one.'
