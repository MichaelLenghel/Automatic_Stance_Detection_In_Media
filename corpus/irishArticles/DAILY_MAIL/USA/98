And despite boasting a string of stunning supermodels, including Heidi Klum and Claudia Schiffer, it's German women at the bottom of the list for ladies joining the dating website - with only thirteen per cent of their applications approved. The Los Angeles-based website has also revealed that this is Ireland's worst ever results in their annual 'beauty charts' which looks at how many people get approved to join their five million members. In contrast, 35 per cent of Irish women who apply to join the website are approved - making them the sixth 'most beautiful' in the world, tied with France and ahead of the USA. Those in Dublin are the most attractive on the Island of Ireland, according to the website, followed by Cork, Galway and Belfast, with those in Limerick being least likely to make the cut.  German men are also tied with French men, coming in as the 12th best looking in the world with 20 per cent of their applications approved. Speaking about the trends for both Irish men and women, Greg Hodge, Managing Director of BeautifulPeople, told the Mirror: 'There are many examples of very handsome Irish men in Hollywood, such as Cillian Murphy, Colin Farrell, Michael Fassbender and Jamie Dornan.  'However, this is the exception and not the norm. Unfortunately, when you look at the stats, Irish men are the undisputed ugliest in the world. They really are in a league of their own. 'But Irish women are continuing to improve their beauty rankings. We looked closely into why Irish women are climbing and Irish men are falling in the beauty rankings. What we found is that a large proportion of Irish women are applying from Dublin - known to be one of the more beautiful areas for Irish inhabitants, whereas the majority of male applicants came from Belfast and Galway, as well as more rural areas which historically have housed some of Ireland's least attractive inhabitants.'  On average, only one in five people make the cut to join the 'elite' dating website, but it's much higher for Scandinavian nations. More than seventy per cert of Norwegian women that apply to join the website are approved, followed by 62 per cent of women in neighbouring Sweden and 61 per cent of those from Iceland. Swedish men fare the best with 60 per cent of their applications being approved, followed by 41 per cent of Brazillian men and 40 per cent of Danish men. Beautifulpeople.com founded in 2002 by Greg Hodge, who has repeatedly defended the websites dating criteria. Speaking on ITV's This Morning in 2015, he said the website defines beauty in a fair and democratic way' and that 'thousands' of people have been married and had children after meeting on it.
