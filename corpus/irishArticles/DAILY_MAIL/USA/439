Liev Schreiber spoke of his deep affection for Australia while attending the G'Day USA event in Beverly Hills on Saturday.   The 52-year-old actor, who has two children with former partner of 12 years, Aussie actress Naomi Watts, encouraged people to donate to bushfire charities.  'I'm thoroughly committed to Australia. Twelve years and two kids will do that,' he told The Daily Telegraph on Saturday.  'I have two kids who are Australian and care deeply about the wildlife. So donate to wildlife, particularly WIRES,' he said.  Liev went on to describe his connection to the country - but says he spends less time there since his split with Naomi in 2016.   'Australia is one of my favourite places and I love it,' the Ray Donovan actor told the paper.  He added: 'I have a deep connection. Since Naomi (Watts) and I split up, I haven't been as much but my kids go all the time'.  Since splitting, the New York based former couple have remained committed to co-parenting their sons Alexander, 12, and Samuel (Kai), 11, and are often seen on outings together.  Naomi told the Australian Womens Weekly last year that the secret to their families success was routine.   'Obviously Liev and I are actors - there is some moving - but we've really tried to keep the boys in the same school. Give them structure, boundaries,' she said.  Naomi has since been romantically linked to her Gypsy co-star Billy Crudup while Liev is rumoured to be dating Miss South Dakota, Taylor Niesen, 26. Streaming service Stan is a proud sponsor of G'Day USA.
