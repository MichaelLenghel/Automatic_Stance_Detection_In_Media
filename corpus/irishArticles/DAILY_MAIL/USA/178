Undefeated IBF featherweight champion Josh Warrington has re-signed with Eddie Hearn's Matchroom Promotions. Warrington's move comes three years after he split with Hearn to join rival Frank Warren, citing differences of opinion. The Leeds fighter is targeting lucrative unification bouts in the United States after making a successful third defence of his title against Sofiane Takoucht in October. Warrington said: 'It's great to be back with Matchroom. Now I'm looking forward to going on to achieve my dreams of both fighting in the USA and unifying the division.' Warrington became his city's first male world champion when he beat Lee Selby to claim the title at Elland Road in May 2018. He subsequently overcame two-weight world champion Carl Frampton in a 'fight of the year' contender before an edgy points win over Kid Galahad. Hearn said: 'I'm ecstatic to welcome Josh Warrington back to Matchroom. 'We had some amazing times helping to build Josh in Leeds and now we reunite at a time when he is the king of the division. '
