They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder - but it's hard not to get skin tingles when you see these stunning images.  They are winning pictures and shortlisted entries from the sixth annual International Landscape Photographer of the Year competition.  More than 3,400 photos were entered into the contest from both amateur and professional photographers from around the globe. The shots feature everything from remote beaches to moody mountain ranges.   Oleg Ershov from Russia has been revealed as the Photographer of the Year (an award based on a folio submission of at least four images) for his shots of Cumbrian beaches and Icelandic streams.  Oleg is an amateur who funds his passion for photography by working at a food distribution company.    The Landscape Photograph of the Year prize, meanwhile, was awarded to Magali Chesnel from France, for her shot entitled 'The Harvest of Road Salt', which depicts the Salin de I’île Saint Martin in Gruissan, France.  Scroll down to see a selection of the eye-widening images that were presented to the judges during the contest...
