ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) - The Dallas Wings acquired former UConn player Katie Lou Samuelson on Friday along with a 2021 first-round draft pick from the Chicago Sky for Azura Stevens. Samuelson was the fourth overall pick in last year's draft after finishing second in UConn history in 3-pointers. The 22-year-old has played 10 games with Team USA over the past year but was limited to 7.6 minutes per game as a rookie in Chicago. The Wings get Chicago's first-round pick in next year's draft for Stevens, the No. 6 choice in the 2018 draft. Stevens was limited to nine games by injury last season after averaging 8.9 points and 4.6 rebounds as a rookie with Dallas. The trade for Samuelson came two days after the Wings granted Skylar Diggins-Smith's request for a trade by sending the four-time All-Star to Phoenix for the fifth and seventh picks in this year's draft along with the Mercury's 2021 first-rounder. Dallas subsequently sent the 2021 Phoenix pick to Chicago for Astou Ndour. The Wings currently have four of the first nine picks in this year's draft, set for April 17. Samuelson averaged 2.4 points per game in 20 games in her only season with the Sky.
