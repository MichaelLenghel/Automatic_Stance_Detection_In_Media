They've been friends since high school. So it makes sense that Michael Clifford wants his 5 Seconds of Summer bandmates to be by his side on his wedding day. The 24-year-old guitarist, who is engaged to model Crystal Leigh, told Fitzy & Wippa at the G'Day USA gala in Los Angeles on Saturday that he'd asked the 5SOS boys to be his groomsmen. 'This is actually the first time I've said this but I've asked all these guys to be my groomsmen,' Michael revealed on the red carpet. Lead singer Luke Hemmings added: 'The clock was running out. We were a bit worried. "When is he gonna ask us?"' Bass player Calum Hood will be Michael's best man. 'We were talking about it for a long time and the only reason I picked Calum is I've known him the longest,' Michael explained.   It comes after Michael and Crystal shared a video to Instagram on Thursday of the couple passionately kissing. In the background of the clip, a friend could be heard discussing the groom's upcoming bachelor party.  Crystal wrote in the caption: 'Four years in and it still feels like the first four months, eternal honeymoon phase, that's how you know.'   Michael proposed to Crystal in January 2019 after three years of dating. 5SOS was formed in western Sydney in 2011 by Michael, Luke, Calum and drummer Ashton Irwin when all four members were in school.
