A hungry raccoon was caught breaking into a house through the cat flap to steal some food. The video was filmed by 18-year-old Laura Bowman, a student from Nashville, Tennessee, USA, on January 21.  Footage shows the raccoon peeping through the cat flap before spotting some dog treats and breaking into the house. The raccoon is then seen smelling and eating the treats directly from the bag. It suddenly stops in its tracks as it makes direct eye contact with Ms Bowman. The mammal quickly scurries away before gingerly peeping its head back through the cat flap. It then reaches out its paw to take another piece of dog treat that's been scattered on the floor and quietly slips back outside.  Ms Bowman said she wasn't too bothered about sharing her dog's food.     She said: 'I wasn't shocked when I saw the raccoon. 'It was eating our dog food - It didn't stay long, maybe five minutes. 'We had the dog food outside the door before but it was eating from it so we brought it inside and then the raccoon decided to use the cat door. 'Nothing like this has happened to me before.'
