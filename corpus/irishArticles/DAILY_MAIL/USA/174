She received four nominations at the 2020 NME Awards.  And FKA twigs was dressed to win as she attended the glitzy ceremony, held at London's O2 Arena on Wednesday night.  The stunning singer, 32, looked radiant at the event as she graced the red carpet in a typically quirky ensemble.  FKA twigs, real name Tahliah Debrett Barnett, ensured all eyes would be on her as she donned a green fur hat.  She teamed the garment with a pinstripe blazer jacket embroidered with gold pattern, that she layered over a tie-dye shirt and black trousers.  The Cellophane singer completed the look with a pair of lace up black heels, whilst she styled her dip dyed locks in tight braids.  FKA twigs was hoping for a successful night after she received nominations for Best Album In The World and Best British Album for Magdalene.  The stunning songstress was also up for Best British Solo Act and Best Solo Act In The World on the night.   FKA twigs' appearance came after she attended the 62nd Grammys ceremony last month, where she appeared onstage with Usher, who performed a Prince tribute with Sheila E. After fans questioned why she merely danced on stage, whilst Usher and Sheila E. sang mash up of Prince's tweets, FKA Twigs subsequently claimed she was not offered a chance to do more.   'Of course I wanted to sing at the Grammys,' she tweeted. 'I wasn't asked this time but hopefully in the future.' However, Sheila E. told USA Today that FKA twigs had been offered a chance to sing in the outing, but declined due to an equipment-related issue. 'She didn't want to sing; first she wanted to, but then she didn't want to when we ran through it because she didn't have a [microphone] pack and [in-ear monitors], so she couldn't hear,' Sheila E. said. She added: 'And she would rather have danced - which is what we asked her as well. She chose not to, she said "No, I'm OK."' FKA twigs had been nominated for Best Music Video at the Grammys, for Cellophane, but lost out to Lil Nas X & Billy Ray Cyrus' Old Town Road (Official Movie).   BEST ALBUM IN THE WORLD Billie Eilish – 'When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?'
