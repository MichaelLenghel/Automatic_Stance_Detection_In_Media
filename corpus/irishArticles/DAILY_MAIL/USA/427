Channel Nine star Richard Wilkins looks set to become godfather to friend Karl Stefanovic and Jasmine Yarbrough's baby.  Reported in New Idea magazine on Monday, the 65-year-old was placed as the 'likely' candidate for the role.   Richard and Karl are known to be good friends, having worked on the Today show together for more than a decade. The Nine entertainment reporter was also invited to Karl's lavish wedding in Mexico, in December 2018, along with his family.    Richard's socialite son Christian is also close to the presenter and wife Jasmine. He's often seen standing with the shoe designer's close friends at Mara & Mine events.  Christian even referred to Karl as 'daddy' in an Instagram snap in June 2018, in which he was seen sandwiched between his father and Karl.   It comes after it was revealed that Karl and Jasmine will be having a daughter in May, according to a report in The Sunday Telegraph.     The publication reported that the couple held a lavish gender reveal party at the Crystal Room at Melbourne's Crown on Friday. The Today show host initially said he and Jasmine were going to wait to find out the sex of the baby, in a previous interview with The Kyle and Jackie O Show.    'There's been so much of us that is public [during] the whole thing, we've been trying to hold on to ours,' he said on the KIIS FM show. Karl then joked: 'I think pregnancy is one of those things that is really boring!' On December 30, Karl posted a snap of himself at the beach on his Instagram. In the caption, he poked fun at his weight gain while confirming that Jasmine is pregnant and expecting their first child. Karl has three children from his previous marriage, Jackson, 20, Ava Willow, 13, and River, 12.
