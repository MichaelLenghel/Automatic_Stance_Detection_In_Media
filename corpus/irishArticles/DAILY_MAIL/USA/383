The Houston Astros will sign Dusty Baker to a one-year contract to manage the team, multiple outlets reported Wednesday. According to Bob Nightengale of USA Today, the deal includes a team option for 2021, he said. Baker will replace A.J. Hinch, who was fired earlier this month after an MLB investigation found the team stole signs electronically in 2017. General manager Jeff Luhnow also was let go, and the Astros now will look to hire his successor. Pitchers and catchers are scheduled to report to the Astros' spring training facility in West Palm Beach, Fla., in two weeks. Baker, 70, will become the major league's oldest manager but will provide the Astros with an experienced leader in the short term and give them time to chart a long-term plan. He last managed in 2017, when his Washington Nationals squad won 97 games. As a bonus, he will manage the American League squad in the 2020 All-Star Game, Nightengale reported. That honor goes to the manager of the reigning league champion, and Hinch was scheduled to lead the team in July in Los Angeles. Baker compiled a 1,863-1,636-1 record in 22 seasons. He guided the San Francisco Giants to the National League pennant in 2002 before losing to the Anaheim Angels in the World Series. Baker produced 10 90-win campaigns during his tenures with the Giants, Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati Reds and Nationals. He won three National League Manager of the Year awards in San Francisco. Other candidates considered for the post included former big-league managers Brad Ausmus, John Gibbons and Buck Showalter, and Chicago Cubs third-base coach Will Venable. --Field Level Media
