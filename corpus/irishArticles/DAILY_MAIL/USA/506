AC Milan are ready to make a stunning move for Wigan defender Antonee Robinson. Due to Financial Fair Play concerns, the Rossoneri could be offloading left-back Ricardo Rodriguez to Fenerbahce and chasing a replacement. And Wigan's former Everton full-back Antonee Robinson, who was born in Milton Keynes but plays for the USA due to his father, is on their radar. The 22-year-old only joined Wigan in the summer after his contract expired at the Premier League club. Milan spotted Robinson in a sweep of emerging talent and think he has the talent to play for their side in the Italian elite.  Milan have also identified Nottingham Forest's Matt Cash as a target, having also looked at Derby's Jayden Bogle.
