OBERHOF, Germany (AP) - Germany큦 Johannes Ludwig won a men큦 World Cup luge race Saturday, his second victory of the season. Ludwig took the gold with a two-run time of 1 minute, 28.267 seconds. Semen Pavlichenko of Russia was second in 1:28.431 and Inars Kivienieks of Latvia was third in 1:28.437. Russia큦 Roman Repilov was eighth, good enough to keep him ahead of Italy큦 Dominik Fischnaller for the season points lead with two races remaining. Jonny Gustafson was the top U.S. finisher, placing 22nd, and Tucker West lost control of the sled in his first run on the way to a 30th-place showing -- despite having the fourth-best time in the second heat. In doubles, Germany큦 Tobias Wendl and Tobias Arlt got their second win of the season and moved closer to fellow Germans Toni Eggert and Sascha Benecken for the season title. Eggert and Benecken remained in the lead despite placing sixth.
