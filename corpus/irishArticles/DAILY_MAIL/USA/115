SAN ANTONIO (AP) - Jared Savage scored 24 points and grabbed a career-high 16 rebounds as Western Kentucky beat UTSA 77-73 in overtime on Saturday. Jhivvan Jackson, who came in as the nation's second-leading scorer at 26.9 points per game, finished with 27 and became UTSA's all-time leading scorer with 1,924 points, passing Devin Brown (1,922 points, 1998-02). However, the junior was just 8-of-24 shooting, making 3 of 10 from the arc, and missed his last five field-goal attempts in overtime. WKU's Taveion Hollingsworth, who scored 23 points, made two free throws for a 75-71 lead with 29.6 seconds left in overtime. Jackson was fouled behind the 3-point arc with 4.4 left and made two free throws before failing to hit the rim while trying to miss the third. Savage then made two free throws. Hollingsworth's one-hander in the paint tied the game at 64 with 41.9 seconds left in regulation and Jackson and Hollingsworth then missed jumpers. Josh Anderson and Jordan Rawls finished 10 points each for the Hilltoppers (18-8, 11-3 Conference USA), who made 25 of 32 free throws to 10 of 10 for UTSA. Keaton Wallace scored 25 points and Jacob Germany had 10 points and 10 rebounds for the Roadrunners (12-15, 6-8). ___ For more AP college basketball coverage: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and http://twitter.com/AP_Top25
