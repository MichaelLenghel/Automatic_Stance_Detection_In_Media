Following are reactions to his death: ADAM SILVER, NBA COMMISSIONER "The NBA family is devastated by the tragic passing of Kobe Bryant and his daughter, Gianna.

He was one of the most extraordinary players in the history of our game with accomplishments that are legendary: five NBA championships, an NBA MVP award, 18 NBA All-Star selections, and two Olympic gold medals. "But he will be remembered most for inspiring people around the world to pick up a basketball and compete to the very best of their ability. He was generous with the wisdom he acquired and saw it as his mission to share it with future generations of players, taking special delight in passing down his love of the game to Gianna." MICHAEL JORDAN, SIX-TIMES NBA CHAMPION "I am in shock over the tragic news of Kobe's and Gianna's passing. Words can't describe the pain I'm feeling. I loved Kobe - he was like a little brother to me. We used to talk often, and I will miss those conversations very much.

Kobe was an amazing dad who loved his family deeply - and took great pride in his daughter's love for the game of basketball." BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, ON TWITTER "Kobe was a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act.
