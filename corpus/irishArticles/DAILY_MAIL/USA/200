Atlanta United goalkeeper Brad Guzan agreed to a contract extension through the 2023 season, the team announced Monday. Guzan, 35, has been Atlanta's starter since joining the team midway through the 2017 season. He has a 44-19-17 record with 30 shutouts in 81 regular-season appearances. "Brad has been one of the top goalkeepers in MLS since joining our team in the summer of 2017 and we are pleased to have agreed to a long-term contract extension," Atlanta United technical director Carlos Bocanegra said in a club statement. "Brad epitomizes the type of professional player we want at Atlanta United, and as a key member of the US men's national team, we hope to see him represent our club at the 2022 FIFA World Cup. He's thoroughly deserved this extension and we look forward to him anchoring our team for years to come." Guzan had a base salary of $680,000 last season, according to the MLS Player Salaries database, when he went 18-12-4 with 14 shutouts. Guzan spent nine seasons in the Premier League before joining Atlanta United. He also played for Chivas USA of MLS from 2005-08. In seven MLS seasons, Guzan is 70-52-36 with 54 shutouts in 160 appearances (159 starts). Atlanta United opens the 2020 season against expansion Nashville SC on Feb. 29. --Field Level Media
