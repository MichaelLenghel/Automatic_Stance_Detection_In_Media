Dating app Bumble and alcoholic beverage company Stella Artois turned to Olivia Culpo for some publicity for Valentine's Day. The former pageant queen, 27, served as host for the Stella Heartois Experience on Thursday night in LA. For the occasion, she chose a white baby doll dress and matching heels.  After winning the 2012 Miss Rhode Island USA competition, she went on to win the Miss USA pageant in 2012. Culpo represented the United States at the Miss Universe pageant in 2012 in Las Vegas and won the title. She is most famous, though, for her romances with high profile male stars. From  2013 to 2015 she dated musician Nick Jonas. She then dated football player Danny Amendola from February 2016 to April 2019 and is currently in a relationship with football player, Christian McCaffrey. Culpo and Carolina Panthers running back McCaffrey, 23, are thought to have struck up a romance last July, when they were seen together on a trip to Mexico.  'It's really easy for us, so I'm grateful,' Olivia said of her relationship to People last month, adding, 'We have so much in common.'
