Jessica Gomes opted for some edge as she attended the the G'Day USA event in Beverly Hills on Saturday.   The 35-year-old chose a chic black suit in a satin fabric with velvet lapels, which skimmed her slender figure.  The model wore a black bra under the jacket, which featured a plunging v-neck that showed off a glimpse of cleavage.  The David Jones model added a pair of pants in the same fabric, which had a slight bootleg cut.  The trendy trousers opened to a pair of white, patent stiletto heels with a pointed tip.   The beauty carried a gold, beaded clutch purse, and wore a number of matching accessories including a cross necklace, a watch and rings.  For makeup, she chose a rosy palette, including a flush of blush, soft pink lipstick in a satin finish and a peachy eye-shadow.  Her skin absolutely glowed, with a hint of highlighter adding focus to her delicate features.   Jessica opted to have her brunette hair down in a softly tussled style that added a rocker edge to the look.   G'Day USA, which is a Stan-sponsored event, brought out a host of celebrities on the night.  It comes after the stunner celebrated New Year's Eve in a quintessentially Australian style. The model flew home for the holidays and spent her days soaking up the sun at Cottesloe Beach in Perth. She shared a photo to Instagram of herself posing in a skimpy red bikini and trucker cap while sipping an ice cold Kirks ginger beer.
