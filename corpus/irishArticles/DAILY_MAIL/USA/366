AC Milan have made a £10million bid for Wigan Athletic full-back Antonee Robinson. The 22-year old USA international only joined from Everton last summer and is poised to complete a fairytale move to Serie A on Friday. Robinson has started all of Wigan's games in the Championship this season, catching the eye of the fallen Italian side.  The left-back never played for Everton's first-team, and was shipped out on loan for two seasons by the Merseyside club to Bolton and Wigan, who were impressed enough to seal a permanent £1.3m deal.  The Premier League side will receive a payment through a sell-on clause, but Robinson will hope to prove they missed out on much more in Italy.    He will join a Milan side in revival. After ending 2019 outside the Serie A top 10, Stefano Pioli has guided them to five straight victories.  The rejuvenation seemed to coincide with the celebrated return of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, a player who Robinson will share the dressing room if he seals the move.
