Anthony Joshua's next potential opponent Kubrat Pulev has been deported from the United States and sent back to Bulgaria due to a visa issue, according to The Athletic.  The Bulgarian heavyweight boxer was reportedly boarding a flight from Chicago to Las Vegas to attend Tyson Fury's seventh-round knockout of Deontay Wilder on Sunday morning.  Pulev was set to fight British champion Joshua for three heavyweight titles in the UK in June.   The 38-year-old has recently warned Joshua that he is ready to bust him up in his own backyard and strip him of his world titles ahead of their proposed heavyweight clash. Negotiations for Joshua's mandatory defence against Pulev are still ongoing with the location and venue proving to be a stumbling block.  The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium has emerged as a frontrunner to stage Joshua's first defence of the titles he recaptured last year after exacting revenge on Andy Ruiz Jnr in Saudi Arabia. And Pulev insisted he would be willing to make the trip over to fight Britain's unified champion if there is no leeway to take the fight abroad. 'Calm down champ, I see that you are very worried to fight away from home and you are absolutely right to be,' Pulev wrote on social media. 'But rest assured, if necessary I'm ready to come to London and bust you up in front of your own fans! 'Until then, tell Mr. Hearn not to get ahead of himself, we do not have a deal yet!'
