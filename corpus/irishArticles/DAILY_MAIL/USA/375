Olympic swimming champion Shane Gould is determined to make history.  The 2018 Australian Survivor winner is on a mission to dominate the franchise again, ahead of the show's All-Stars debut.   'I'm going to try and make history by equalling the record of only one survivor player worldwide to win twice,' Shane, 63,  told The Mercury. 'Sandra Diaz-Twine, from Survivor USA, has won it twice. No one else has in all the Survivor franchises,' she continued. It comes after Channel Ten announced that the show will be starting on February 3.  In an added bonus for fans, the network has dropped a new teaser of the Olympic legend ahead of the show's debut, where she says she's been studying 'chimpanzee politics'.  'I've studied chimpanzee politics. Politics in the jungle... I'm ready for the monkey business!' she said.  The upcoming series will see Survivor fan favourites - and some of the show's most controversial contestants - back for an All Stars round. Season three winner, Shane, who was the oldest contestant to ever win the series at 63, is among the stars to join the 2020 cast.  The series will also see villain 'Dirty' Harry Hills, who made the final three last year, return to battle it out for another crack at victory.  Olympic skier Lydia Lassila, who was booted in a blindside orchestrated by Shane, was the final addition to be announced in a recent trailer. Australian Survivor: All Stars will premiere Monday, February 3 on Channel 10
