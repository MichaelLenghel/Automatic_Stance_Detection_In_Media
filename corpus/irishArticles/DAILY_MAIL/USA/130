CHICAGO -- Team USA found its shooting stroke in the second half and buried Team World 151-131 in the Rising Stars Game on Friday to kick off All-Star Weekend festivities at United Center. Eric Paschall led Team USA with 23 points and RJ Barrett had a game high 27 points. As Team USA put the game away in the fourth, players stepped aside to let Team USA forward Zion Williamson try a series of spectacular dunks. Team USA's Miles Bridges has 20 points and was named MVP of the game. "Coaches were getting on the team saying, `Are you going to play for real?'" Bridges said of his 13-point surge in the third quarter. Bench players propelled Team USA into the lead in the third, when the World team was outscored 44-24. Bridges connected on 3-pointers in back-to-back possessions to cut a 12-point lead in half just inside of the 5-minute mark in the third quarter. Three minutes later, Devonte' Graham made a pair of 3s of his own on consecutive possessions and Team USA had its first lead, 104-103, since the opening minutes of the game. Luka Doncic launched a shot from half court with two seconds remaining in the second quarter that helped stake Team World to an 81-71 lead at halftime. Team USA bailed on a perimeter attack in the second quarter in favor of a barrage of rim-bending dunks highlighted by Williamson's catch and flush of a lob from Ja Morant. Team World opened a 13-point lead -- 37-24 -- with two minutes left in the first quarter, which included one foul and 24 combined 3-point attempts.
