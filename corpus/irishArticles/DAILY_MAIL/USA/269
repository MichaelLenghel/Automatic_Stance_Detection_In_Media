Manchester City are monitoring Swansea City's highly-rated centre back Joe Rodon. The 22-year-old Wales international has returned to Steve Cooper's starting line-up in recent weeks after recovering from an ankle injury that had sidelined him since October. City want two centre backs in the summer and remain keen on Leicester's Ben Chilwell also. Rodon is 6ft 4ins tall yet composed on the ball and his style has attracted the attention of top-flight sides and earned him recognition from national team manager Ryan Giggs who gave him his Wales debut in September. Bournemouth, Everton, Leicester, Chelsea and Arsenal have all watched Rodon over the past 18 months after he broke into Swansea's first team under previous manager Graham Potter. He is also likely to be part of Giggs's squad for Wales' friendlies against Austria and USA next month. Rodon has been compared to City's John Stones, who has dropped out of favour in recent weeks, though the Swansea defender tends to take less risks. City scouts have recognised his potential and will continue to check his progress aware that they face competition from other Premier League sides. As well as question marks over Stones's future, City could yet allow Nicolas Otamendi to leave in the summer. Fernandinho has deputised admirably in a deeper defensive role and has signed a new year one-year deal but City want cover for the 34-year-old Brazilian as well as another centre back. Benfica's 20-year old Florentino Luis, who was subject of an offer from AC Milan last week, is another defensive midfielder that City have watched and admire as a potential successor to Fernandinho in the squad.
