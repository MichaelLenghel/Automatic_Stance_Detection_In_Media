The search for the next big star in athletics is always intense when an Olympic Games is on the horizon. And in USA-born Swede Armand Duplantis, the sport may be looking at yet another bright young talent who could go on to create an unprecedented piece of history. The 20-year-old demonstrated that he had made another great stride after breaking his own pole vault world record by clearing 6.18m at the Indoor Grand Prix in Glasgow on Saturday. The feat came just a week after the world silver medallist had beaten Frenchman Renaud Lavillenie's previous mark of 6.16m - set in February 2014 in Donetsk, Ukraine - by clearing 6.17m in Torun, Poland.  It was Duplantis' first attempt at the height and after clearing it in languid fashion and with room to spare, he received $30,000 (£23,000) for his achievement. The records he has set in the last fortnight however has not stopped Duplantis of dreaming of further success in Tokyo this summer.  'There are a lot of reasons why this event is so complicated and so many things go into making a good jump,' Duplantis told BBC Sport. 'So many years of hard work go into this, but when you do it right it seems simple.' 'Safe to say I feel good, I feel fast and strong on the runway. I'm excited for the outdoor season, and the Olympics is where I want to be the best.'  Duplantis, who was born in Louisiana but subsequently chose to represent his mother's native Sweden, goes by the nickname 'Mondo' and at 17 had already cleared 5.90m. He is also coached by American father Greg, who himself was a polevaulter, while mother Helena is a former heptathlete and volleyball player.
