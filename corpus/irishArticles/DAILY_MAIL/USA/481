Former Miss Universe Australia Francesca Hung made headlines in 2018 during a 'racism' scandal at the Miss Universe pageant. In a candid interview with Stellar magazine, the 25-year-old model, who was filmed discussing non-English speaking competitors with other contestants, admitted that the incident almost ruined her career. 'That was a very low moment. I was crying. I didn't have any family or friends with me,' she told the publication. Scroll down for video  'I remember thinking my career was over before it had really even started,' the model, who was recently announced as the new E! Australia host, admitted.  Francesca has also in the past expressed her regret for not putting an end to the discussion at the time. Speaking to The Daily Telegraph last year, she admitted: 'If I had my time over again, I definitely wouldn't be a part of that video and, if I had my time again, maybe I would have said something to Miss USA in that moment.' She also said that she was 'angry' that the video may have led to her losing out on the Miss Universe crown. In 2018, Francesca was seen alongside Miss USA Sarah Rose Summers and Miss Columbia Valeria Morales in a video filmed during rehearsals in Bangkok, Thailand.  The trio were accused of being 'racist' after appearing to make fun of contenders Miss Vietnam H'Hen Nie and Miss Cambodia, Rern Sinat for speaking poor English. 'Miss Cambodia is here and doesn't speak any English and not a single other person here speaks her language,' Miss USA said.   'Could you imagine? Like Francesca said, that would be so isolating and I said yes, and I mean, just confusing all the time,' she continued. Francesca added to the conversation at the time, by nodding and saying: 'It would be really hard.'
