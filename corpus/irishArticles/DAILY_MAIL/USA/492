She's expecting her third child with husband, actor Sam Worthington. And on Wednesday, Lara Worthington (née Bingle) covered up her growing bump under hoodie as she went to a nail salon in West Hollywood, California.  The Australian model proved she is still a local girl as she stepped out wearing a South Sydney Rabbitohs cap.  The South Sydney Rabbitohs are an Australian rugby league team based in Redfern, Sydney. The blonde added a pair of black tights to her dark hooded sweatshirt, with her famous face partially covered.  A pair of black running shoes completed the athletic ensemble, with which she wore black socks.  Lara carried a mobile phone in her hand, as well as a white phone charger and her wallet.   The beauty appeared to have opted for a vampy look for her manicure, her dark nails visible.   The model revealed to Vogue Australia late last year that she is expecting her third son with husband, actor Sam Worthington, 43, who she married in 2014.   The couple share two young sons, Rocket, four, and Racer, three, and are now based in the USA.      In an interview with The Daily Telegraph's Stellar Magazine in April last year, Lara hinted that they may not stop at three children.  'We would love a big family and I would definitely have more... Some days are great, others are harder, but watching them grow up is the greatest thing,' she said.
