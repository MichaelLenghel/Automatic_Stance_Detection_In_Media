Brentford have had a bid rejected for £5m plus add-ons for Arsenal striker Folarin Balogun.  The Gunners turned down an offer and the Championship promotion hopefuls could face shock competition for Balogun, 18, from AC Milan with the Serie A side scouring the market as they target young English talent. Prolific England under-18 striker Balogun has come to the attention of both clubs after two especially prolific seasons at youth level for Arsenal. New York born Balogun, who moved to England when he was two and whose parents are of Nigerian descent, is rated as one of the best young attacking talents in England. He scored 28 goals in 28 games at youth level for Arsenal last season, including 25 in just 19 under-18 games. His scoring streak has continued this term with seven goals and four assists in 12 games at under-23 level, during a campaign disrupted by niggling injury. Balogun is the next English youngster in the sights of Milan, whose CEO is former Arsenal chief Ivan Gazidis. Milan are also looking in England for a full-back and have identified Nottingham Forest's Matt Cash as a target, having also looked at Derby's Jayden Bogle and Wigan's former Everton full-back Antonee Robinson, who was born in Milton Keynes but now plays for the USA.
