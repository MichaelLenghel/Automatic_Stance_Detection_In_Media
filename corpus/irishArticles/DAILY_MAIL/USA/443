Danielle Macdonald has revealed that her family were personally affected by the bushfire crisis.  Speaking at the G'Day USA event in Beverly Hills, the 28-year-old actress broke down in tears as she described the devastation in New South Wales. The Bird Box star told The Daily Telegraph: 'We were at my cousin's house at Bateman's Bay over Christmas and three days later their house burned down.  'We ended up driving 13 hours south to get out and it was a journey that should have taken three hours. 'But seeing the dead animals in the burnt-out areas we drove through is something I can never unsee. It's horrifying'.   Now based in America, Danielle's career has gone from strength to strength, and she recently revealed what it was like to work alongside Jennifer Aniston, 50, on the Netflix hit Dumplin'. Speaking to Stellar Magazine, Danielle recalled how she hung out with Jennifer at the Hollywood star's Bel Air mansion to get into the role as her daughter.

I felt very safe and calm around her,' Danielle told the publication.  In the film, Danielle played the titular character who is teased for being plus-sized and has the nickname 'Dumplin' while her mother - played by Jennifer - is a former pageant queen.    Danielle also appeared in the Netflix movie Bird Box starring Sandra Bullock.
