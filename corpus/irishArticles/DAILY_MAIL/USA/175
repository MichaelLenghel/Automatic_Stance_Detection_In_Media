The Matildas will face the USA three times in the next two years, Football Federation Australia has confirmed. The Australian women's soccer team will take on the reigning world champions in Utah in April, before hosting the 2019 World Cup winners in a two-match series in November 2021. April's match in the USA will be played at the 20,000-capacity Rio Tinto Stadium on April 10 (local time), and will come as the first leg of a North American series which includes a clash against Canada at BC Place in Vancouver on April 14 (local time). FFA will make further announcements regarding the November 2021 home series in due course. "It is important we focus on the job we have to do to qualify for Tokyo 2020, however should we be successful in our aim to reach the Olympics playing the USA, as well as Canada, this April will form a key part of our preparations," Matildas head coach Ante Milicic said. Securing two matches in Australia against the USA next year is also a major milestone for football in Australia and will provide our players with strong opposition as they embark on the next AFC Women's Asian Cup and FIFA Women's World Cup cycle." Australia hosted the USWNT in two matches in 2000 in Adelaide and Newcastle, and three games in 1997 in Melbourne, Bathurst, and Canberra.
