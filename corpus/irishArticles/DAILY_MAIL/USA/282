Paula Abdul took to Twitter on Monday to explain why she appeared to mistake a photo of Nicole Scherzinger for a photo of Shakira.  She'd puzzled fans when she tweeted her excitement at seeing Demi Lovato, Jennifer Lopez and Shakira perform at Super Bowl LIV on Sunday but included a montage of photos of herself with Lovato, JLo and Scherzinger.  Abdul explained: '@NicoleScherzy I wanted to include this photo to commemorate this great football memory! Not to mistake you for Shakira. Nicole, even as a masked singer I couldn’t mistake you. As if we don’t go way back! xoP.' Abdul and Scherzinger worked together on the first season of The X Factor USA. The photo she'd used was a group shot of herself with Simon Cowell, Randy Jackson and Scherzinger at a past Super Bowl. The former Pussycat Doll responded to the tweet, saying: 'I mean, my hips don’t lie… but I’m not @shakira babes.' Following the Twitter response, Abdul deleted the tweet. Abdul, who had hits with Straight Up, Forever Your Girl, Rush Rush and Opposites Attract between 1989 to 1991, has not herself performed during a Super Bowl halftime show. However, in 2008, she debuted her first single in 12 years during the pre-game show for Super Bowl XLII.  In the pre-taped segment, she lip synced to Dance Like There's No Tomorrow supported by a group of backup dancers and Randy Jackson on guitar. It was part of a series of American Idol promotions linked to the Super Bowl that year. Abdul was a judge on the talent competition for the first eight seasons from 2002 to 2010. In 2011, she became a judge on The X-Factor with Idol's Simon Cowell as well as Cheryl Cole and L.A. Reid with Scherzinger and Steve Jones as co-hosts.
