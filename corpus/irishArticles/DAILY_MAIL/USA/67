A 100-year-old World War II veteran received an unexpected surprise during a Trump rally in Phoenix today as fans brought the man to the front of the stage. The heartwarming video shared on Twitter shows two men - one wearing a Trump hat - carrying the elderly man, Irvin Julian, down a flight of stairs and across Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum as crowds cheered and chanted 'USA! USA!'.  The kind act put the Julian at the front of the action before the rally started.   At the start of Trump's speech Julian received a signed campaign hat and praise from the president himself, who later retweeted the video. The President called the veteran 'a celebrity.'  Phoenix is the latest stop on President's Trump's four-day trip in the West. On Tuesday, Trump held rallies in Los Angeles and Las Vegas.  Before coming to Phoenix, Trump held events in Palm Springs and Bakersfield, California.  Doors for Wednesday's event opened around 3pm, but some supporters began lining up the day before.
