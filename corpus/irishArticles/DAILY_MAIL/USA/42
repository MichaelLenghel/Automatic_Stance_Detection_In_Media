Buffalo coach Lance Leipold had his contract extended through the 2024 season, the school announced Friday. Leipold, 55, was rewarded in part for coaching the Bulls to their first-ever bowl victory, 31-9 over Charlotte in the Bahamas Bowl on Dec. 20. Leipold's deal was set to expire after the 2023 season. He made $615,000 last season, according to the USA Today coaches salary database. "I'm very appreciative of Lance Leipold's unwavering commitment and dedication to building a championship-caliber football program here at UB," athletic director Mark Alnutt said in a statement. "This program has seen outstanding growth and success both on and off the field during his tenure. I'm excited to work with Lance and his staff as we continue this positive trajectory for many years to come." Buffalo went 8-5 last season and is 31-32 during Leipold's tenure. The program is 18-9 over the past two seasons. "We've made improvements on the field, in record, we've made improvements in facilities but we're nowhere near where we need to be," Leipold told the Buffalo News. "The field house has been great. Our meeting rooms are important, but we still have improvements needed. Weight room, our locker room, other things like that. Those are all important, as far as being on the same page, administratively." --Field Level Media
