Melbourne NRL coach Craig Bellamy isn't afraid to look outside of rugby league in his quest for success, spending time with the New York City Fire Department in the off-season. Despite banking over 300 NRL wins, Bellamy and Storm football manager Frank Ponissi head overseas at the end of each season to soak up the knowledge of other organisations. This year they spent time the USA, visiting Philadelphia and Washington as well as the historic fire department headquarters in New York City, which Bellamy said really hit home for him. "We went to their academy and that was probably the most interesting thing we saw, in how they operate and what they do," Bellamy said on Thursday. Bellamy said he was interested in how the NYFD, which employs more than 11,000 firefighters and 4000 ambulance officers and paramedics, dealt with pressure. He also met with NYFD officials who were involved in the September 11 terrorist attack on the city in 2001. "They're working under pressure those guys - when they go and do their job they're not going to lose two (competition) points they might lose their lives or their mates may lose their lives," he said. "We looked at how they train - their mentality is basically to fall back on their training. "It reinforced a lot of things we believe in here as a footy team." Preparing for an 18th NRL season with Melbourne, Bellamy still has two years to run on his contract, while long-time captain Cameron Smith only has 2020. The coach says 36-year-old Smith hasn't given any indication if this season will be his last and he won't be pushing him to do so. "I think it will be the end of the season before he decides but we aren't going to pressure him to make any kind of decision," he said. "For what he's done for this club he deserves to make that decision when he's ready."
