CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) - Jahmir Young matched his season high with 24 points and Jordan Shepherd made a layup with 44 seconds left to give Charlotte the lead en route to a 70-68 win over Florida Atlantic on Thursday night. Later in the final minute, Shepherd hit two free throws, Drew Edwards made one of two and Young also made one of two as the 49ers preserved their lead. It was Young's only miss in 10 free-throw attempts. FAU´s final 3-point attempt - a 30-footer by Cornelius Taylor - was off the mark. Shepherd finished with 13 points and Malik Martin added 12 for Charlotte (11-7, 5-2 Conference USA), which has won six straight at home. Taylor had 16 points for the Owls (12-8, 4-3). Jailyn Ingram added 14 points and Richardson Maitre scored 13. Charlotte rallied from a 14-point second-half deficit as FAU led 58-44 with 7 minutes, 37 seconds remaining. A 13-0 run drew the 49ers within 58-57 with 4:18 to go and they tied it nearly four minutes later when Edwards hit a 3-pointer with 1:23 remaining. Charlotte faces Florida International at home on Saturday. Florida Atlantic plays at Old Dominion on Saturday. ___ For more AP college basketball coverage: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and http://twitter.com/AP_Top25 ___ Elements of this story were generated by Automated Insights, http://www.automatedinsights.com/ap, using data from STATS LLC, https://www.stats.com
