Dior Johnson, a five-star guard in the Class of 2022, committed to play at Syracuse. He announced his decision Friday night on Twitter. "I love the coaching staff as we've been building a strong relationship since I've been in the 7th grade," Johnson wrote. "They've always made sure I was a priority at all times and watched me develop from then to where I'm at now. This feels like home for me as I will have an opportunity to build my own legacy and have the dome rocking every night!!" Johnson, a 6-foot-3, 180-pound point guard, is listed as the nation's No. 1 point guard in his class by the 247Sports composite, and has drawn comparisons to Kyrie Irving. While he plays at Mayfair High School in Lakewood, Calif., he is from Kingston, N.Y., about a three-hour drive from the Syracuse campus. Last spring, he played with Bronny James on the Strive For Greatness 15U team, which is run by LeBron James. "You can't do anything but improve when you're learning from the best," Johnson told USA Today in May 2019 about the decision to join James' team. "Sometimes we forget that he's LeBron because he's so approachable and he's always offering advice. It's big to have the chance to learn from him." He is averaging 22.7 points per game this season for Mayfair, according to MaxPreps. In his blog for SI.com, Johnson said committing to the Orange is the right move for him. "I don't have anything against the Blue Bloods, but I'm the kind of guy who wants to go to a school where I can play against them and beat them," he wrote. "I want to create my own legacy." --Field Level Media
