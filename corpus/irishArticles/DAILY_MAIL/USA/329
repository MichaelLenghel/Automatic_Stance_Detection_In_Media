Unbeaten Sydney rugby sevens starts have Australia's men's and women's sides positioned to end two-year title droughts on Sunday. Charlotte Caslick scored five tries and set up three others at Bankwest Stadium on Saturday as the hosts stirred memories of their incredible 2018 title on home soil. Wins against Spain (33-0) and Ireland (34-0) were reminiscent of their last world rugby sevens series tournament victory, which came without them conceding a single point while scoring 213 of their own across the weekend at Allianz Stadium. Australia hung on to win the world series that year but haven't reached those same dominant heights since, with New Zealand now the team to beat ahead of Tokyo's Olympics from late July. France beat Australia to claim bronze in New Zealand last weekend and the sides will meet again in a high-stakes Sunday morning pool game to decide who progresses to the semi-finals. "It's always pleasing when you don't concede points," women's coach John Manenti said. "Most of our attack stemmed from good defence first (and) although we weren't pushed too hard defensively I thought we did our job today and we know the real test is going to come tomorrow morning with the French." Australia's men also won in Sydney two years ago and could lift the trophy again after a tough win against Scotland followed a commanding defeat of Japan on Saturday. They will play the United States for a spot in the final four on Sunday, confident they can contain speedy pair Perry Baker and Carlin Isles. "The USA are in form and are piling on the points," coach Tim Walsh said. "We will have to play a strategic game and bring the attitude for that match tomorrow morning."
