LSU coach Ed Orgeron agreed to a six-year contract that will pay him $42 million in total compensation, Bruce Feldman of The Athletic reported Friday. The national champion Tigers were undefeated in 2019, capping a perfect 15-0 season with a title game victory over Clemson. LSU is 11-1 in its past 12 against teams ranked in the top 10 and was 7-0 in those games in 2019. Oregeron, 58, made $4 million in 2019, which was tied for 28th in college football according to USA Today Sports' database on college coaching salaries. Since being named interim head coach in 2016, Orgeron has a 40-9 record and is 23-7 in the Southeastern Conference. This offseason, Orgeron must replace passing game coordinator Joe Brady and defensive coordinator Dave Aranda. Brady was hired as offensive coordinator of the Carolina Panthers and Aranda named head coach at Baylor. The Tigers also will need to come up with a quarterback. Heisman Trophy winner Joe Burrow is gone and widely expected to be a top NFL draft pick. --Field Level Media
