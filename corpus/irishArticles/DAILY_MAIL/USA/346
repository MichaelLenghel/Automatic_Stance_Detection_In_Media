The world's most luxurious TV with a waterproof 100'' screen and a 24-carat gold-plated stand has gone on sale at Harrods for over £100,000. Aquavision, the British luxury TV maker, has started selling their new gold-plated TV at the Knightsbridge store. The Aquavision DB100 has a 100', 4K definition, LCD screen and is being exclusively stocked in Harrods costing £108,000. Orders have already been received from the UK, Middle East and the USA. For the new TV's sound system, the maker teamed up with audio specialists Bang & Olufsen.  Alastair Benn, MD at Aquavision, said: 'There is a growing demand for luxury electronic items from consumers around the world and the TV market is no different. 'Homes today are radically different environments to the homes of the past. 'Advances in technology have revolutionised the very nature of what a home is. 'From where we used to simply live, we now live, work, rest and play - and people want to do it in style.  'This is our ultimate luxury television. It is a major statement piece that people with style and wealth can enjoy. 'We believe it is the most stunning and unique television ever produced in the world.' Aquavision clients include celebrities, business leaders, luxury hotels and the most affluent consumers. In 1997, entrepreneur Alastair Benn created the world's first waterproof television from the comforts of his home garage. From Aquavision's humble beginnings to being a present-day market leader of in-wall and on-wall televisions, Aquavision is the choice for luxury entertainment.
