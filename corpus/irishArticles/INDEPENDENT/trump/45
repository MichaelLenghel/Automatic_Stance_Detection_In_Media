Donald Trump's inaugural address held familiar echoes of the campaign speeches that led to his presidential win: downbeat about the state of the nation, to the point of hyperbole. Here is a look at some of his assertions: TRUMP: "The jobs left, and the factories closed ... the wealth, strength and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon." THE FACTS: The US economy is a lot healthier than the wreck Mr Trump describes. Jobs have increased for a record 75 straight months. The US unemployment rate was 4.7% in December, close to a nine-year low and to what economists consider full employment.

 Donald Trump is now the 45th President of the United States  / From July through until September, the economy expanded at a 3.5% annual pace - the fastest in two years.  The Federal Reserve is so confident in the resiliency of the economy that it raised interest rates last month for only the second time in a decade. While wage growth has been sluggish since the Great Recession ended in mid-2009, declining unemployment and steady job growth are starting to force businesses to offer higher pay to find and attract new workers.

Average hourly pay rose last year at the fastest pace in more than seven years. TRUMP: "We've defended other nation's borders while refusing to defend our own." THE FACTS: Hardly.  Since 2001, the US has more than doubled the ranks of the Border Patrol, which now has nearly 20,000 agents. The vast majority of those are stationed along the Mexican border, where about 408,000 people were apprehended during the budget year that ended in September.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria  REUTERS / TRUMP: The US has "subsidised the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military". THE FACTS: The US military may have shortcomings, but it remains the world's most advanced, expensive and far-flung fighting force. American military spending is nearly three times that of second-place China, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

TRUMP: "We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones, and unite the civilised world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth." THE FACTS: Quelling radical Islamic terrorism worldwide is a heavy lift in which the US has been engaged for years, and Mr Trump has offered no plan for how he will deliver on this promise. A US-led coalition began battling Islamic extremism even before 9/11. In Afghanistan alone, the coalition has fought for more than 15 years to prevent al Qaida and other radical groups from regaining a safe harbour there.  Getting the help of Nato allies might prove diplomatically challenging since Mr Trump has called Nato "obsolete" and says European members are not paying their fair share. The threat is only growing.  Islamic State has a global reach, and attacks linked to radical extremism have occurred in the United States, France, Belgium, Turkey and countries throughout northern Africa. AP  PA Media
