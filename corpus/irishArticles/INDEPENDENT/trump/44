Inauguration Day is nearly upon us, whether we like it or not. This Friday,  January 20, Donald Trump will be sworn in as the 45th President of the United States outside the U.S. Capitol in Washington D.C., flanked by his family. Unlike previous presidents with younger children, Trump's four adult children will play key roles in his administration and his youngest son Barron (10) won't even live at the White House (he will remain with his mother Melania at their gilded penthouse in Trump Tower so as not to affect his schooling). But who's who in the White House's non-traditional, incoming First Family?

 Melania Trump waves to the crowd after delivering a speech on the first day of the Republican National Convention  Getty Images / The incoming First Lady (46) is a former model who originally hails from Slovenia. She took a backseat throughout much of her husband's campaign, only making select appearances to publicly support him - including her infamous speech at the Republic National Convention which was largely plagiarised by outgoing First Lady Michelle Obama's DNC speech four years earlier. Despite her avoiding the spotlight, she hasn't been free from controversy - in the early stages of Trump's campaign, nude pictures from her early modelling career were published by the New York Post in August of last year and debate still wages on as to whether or not she graduated from the University of Slovenia with a degree in architecture as her website previously claimed. The bio section in now-defunct website MelaniaTrump.com stated that she had the third level qualification, but it's been largely reported that she left mid-way through her first year of studies. Melania, whose maiden name is Knauss, first met 'The Donald' in 1998 at a party during New York Fashion Week. They wed in 2005 in a ceremony covered by US Vogue and they welcomed their son Barron in March, 2006. While most designers clamour to dress the FLOTUS, a large number of fashion industry bigwigs have publicly boycotted dressing Melania in retaliation to her husband's offensive rhetoric concerning Muslims, women and Mexican immigrants.

(Photo by Mark Makela/Getty Images) Getty Images / Melania might be the official First Lady, but Ivanka (35) is the real queen of the castle. A stalwart by her father's side throughout his two-year campaign, even while heavily pregnant, Ivanka was instrumental in his successful election outcome by softening his image to white female voters. The former model's ethos has been at odds with her father's misogynistic discourse concerning women -  e.g. his 1994 ABC News interview, "I think putting a woman to work is a very dangerous thing" - and pioneered a #WomenWhoWork scheme. She distanced herself at times throughout her father's campaign, describing herself as a "daughter, not a clone".  She is an advocate of affordable childcare and maternity cover, an agenda already being pushed in Congress, but isn't without her own controversy as many of her previous employees allege they were not given paid maternity leave while working for her. In the family's first interview after her father was named President, she separated herself from her eponymous fashion company for trying to sell a $10,000 bracelet she was wearing during the family's 60 Minutes interview, blaming a "well intentioned marketing employee". She is a mother of three - Arabella Rose (five), Joseph Frederick (three) and Theodore James (10 months) - and converted to Judaism to marry Jared Kushner in 2009. In order to comply with ethics laws, Ivanka left her executive position at Trump Organisation so she no longer profits from the company and moved her family to Washington, where she will live just a few doors down from the Obamas in a €5.5m home. It's unclear what her exact role is, but unofficially, she will be the President's most trusted consultant.

Kushner comes frm old New York money and his family boasts a real estate portfolio to rival Trump's, as well as owning the New York Observer newspaper, but he has resigned from all his positions to act as a senior adviser to the President in the White House, a move which has been largely critiqued as being in contradiction with anti-nepotism laws. But Kushner has nestled his way into Trump's inner circle and much like his wife, was considered to be Trump's unofficial campaign manager, developing his digital strategy with "virtually no resources" and no political experience. As former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said in the Forbes interview, "Every president I've ever known has one or two people he intuitively and structurally trusts. I think Jared might be that person." He first met Ivanka in 2007 through mutual friends and they wed two years later in a lavish ceremony at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey (their wedding invitations were rumoured to have contained promotional material for golf courses owned by the family).

 Donald Trump Jr., son of Donald Trump, greets the audience after speaking on the second day of the Republican National Convention  AFP/Getty Images / He and brother Eric might play second fiddle to Ivanka, but the brothers will be responsible for running the family businesses during Trump's run in the White House as the President-elect revealed in a dramatic press conference last week. The 38-year-old reportedly considered a run as Mayor of New York City this year, according to Vanity Fair, an idea his father is said to have quickly extinguished. He, Ivanka and Eric are from Trump's first marriage to socialite Ivana and were raised by their mother and her parents Milos and Maria Zelnicek who lived in Trump Tower, only developing a closer relationship with their father as adults. When news of his father's affair with Marla Maples went public in 1990, 'Donny' lashed out at his father, reflecting on the scandal he experienced as a child with the wisdom of an adult. "Listen, it’s tough to be a 12-year-old,” he told New York magazine in a rare intereview in 2003. "You’re not quite a man, but you think you are. You think you know everything. Being driven into school every day and you see the front page and it’s divorce! THE BEST SEX I EVER HAD! And you don’t even know what that means. At that age, kids are naturally cruel. Your private life becomes very public, and I didn’t have anything to do with it.” He has been married to Vanessa Trump (nee Haydon) since 2005 and they have five children together.

 Eric Trump does a television interview before the ribbon cutting ceremony during the grand opening of the new Trump International Hotel October 26, 2016  Getty Images / Much like his older brother Donald Jr, Eric (33) kept to the shadows for much of his father's campaign and has only ever given a handful of interviews. But the pair will manage the family's business interests over the next four years. Arguably the most low-key member of the Trump family, he has been working as the vice president of the Trump Organisation and unlike his siblings (excluding 10-year-old Barron) has opted away from public life where possible. He wed Lara Yunaska at Mar-A-Lago in 2014 in a ceremony officiated by Jared Kushner. They have no children.

 Tiffany Trump takes part in the roll call in support of Donald Trump on the second day of the Republican National Convention Getty Images / Tiffany (23) is the only child from Trump's brief union to Marla Maples. A recent graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, she was raised predominantly by her mother in Los Angeles while her father remained in New York. Although she did appear on the campaign trail, most notably giving a speech honouring her father at the Republic National Convention, which was praised and slated in equal measure. Growing up, it was well documented she had a distant relationship with her father, but she hit the campaign trail in 2015 and also contributed to his popularity among female and younger voters and is said to consider Ivanka as a mentor. In 2014, she released a single Like a Bird which critics dug up during the campaign, and is preparing to study at law school.

He is currently studying at a private school in New York City, where he will remain with his mother Melania - at least until this year's school term is over. His nickname is "mini Donald" and he is "not a sweatpants child", according to his mother.
