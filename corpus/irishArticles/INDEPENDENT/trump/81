President-elect Donald Trump is shaking up his transition team as he plunges into the work of setting up his administration, elevating Vice President-elect Mike Pence to head the operations. It amounts to a demotion for New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who had been running Mr Trump's transition planning for months. On the heels of Mr Trump's upset victory this week, the Republican's team has been scrambling to identify people for top White House jobs and Cabinet posts. It is an enormous undertaking that must be well in hand by the time Mr Trump is inaugurated on January 20. In a statement on Friday, Mr Trump said Mr Pence would "build on the initial work" done by Mr Christie. "Together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding this nation - specifically jobs, security and opportunity," Mr Trump said. Mr Christie was a loyal adviser to Mr Trump for much of the campaign and came close to being the businessman's pick for running mate. But Mr Trump ultimately went with Indiana governor Mr Pence, a former congressman with Washington experience and deep ties to conservatives.

For Mr Trump, who ran on a pledge to "drain the swamp" of Washington insiders, the team is strikingly heavy on those with long political resumes. In addition, three of Mr Trump's adult children - Don Jr, Eric and Ivanka - are on the transition executive committee, along with Jared Kushner, Ivanka's husband. Mr Kushner played a significant role in Mr Trump's campaign and was spotted at the White House Thursday meeting with President Barack Obama's chief of staff. Mr Pence said the transition staff is made up of the right people to "bring about fundamental change in Washington".

REUTERS/Max Whittaker REUTERS / After ending his own failed campaign for president, Mr Christie emerged as one of Mr Trump's most enthusiastic supporters. He nearly became Mr Trump's running mate but was edged out by Mr Pence. Mr Trump and Mr Christie grew apart through the last stretch of the campaign. The governor became increasingly frustrated that Mr Trump would not listen to his advice, particularly over the response to the release of a 1995 video in which the businessman is heard making predatory comments about women. Mr Christie is also facing calls for impeachment in New Jersey following the conviction of two former aides in the George Washington Bridge lane-closing trial. Mr Christie has denied any knowledge of the lane closures until weeks or months after they occurred in September 2013. The governor was notably absent from the steady stream of advisers entering Mr Trump's eponymous skyscraper in New York for meetings on Friday.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY REUTERS A man leans out of a Hummer shouting words in support of U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump while driving through Times Square in New York, U.S., November 9, 2016. REUTERS/Mark Kauzlarich REUTERS / Among the first decisions facing the president-elect is whom to choose as chief of staff, a key post that will set the tone for Mr Trump's White House and be a key conduit to Capitol Hill and Cabinet agencies. Mr Trump is said to be considering Steve Bannon, his campaign chairman and a conservative media executive, and Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus for the role. Neither has significant policy experience, though Mr Priebus is well-liked in Washington and has deep ties with key politicians. Kellyanne Conway, Mr Trump's campaign manager, is also said to be in the mix for a senior job. Ms Conway is a veteran Republican pollster who formed a strong rapport with the candidate after taking the helm of his campaign in the general election. While Mr Trump has long led a large business, the scope of the federal government exceeds any of his previous endeavours. Those around Mr Trump, who is known as a hands-on executive, say he will likely have to make adjustments in his leadership style and decision-making, including more delegating. Mr Trump has chafed at that a bit, but he has signalled willingness to relinquish some but not all, personal control. He also seems reluctant to expand his core group of aides beyond the inner circle with whom he feels comfortable. Meanwhile, the Secret Service and New York City police are going to extremes to protect Donald Trump when he is at his Manhattan home. Since Election Day the president-elect's neighbours near Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue have had to navigate swarms of police officers, concrete barricades and street closures in the heart of the city's shopping district. Mr Trump lives in the penthouse of the glittering, 664-foot glass skyscraper, and his Trump Organisation has its headquarters there. Some of the security measures are temporary, but officials said the stepped-up protection is not going away. The final look of the restrictions will depend largely on how Mr Trump divides his time between Washington and New York and on the results of a vulnerability assessment of Trump Tower. PA Media
