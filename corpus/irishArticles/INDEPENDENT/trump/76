US President Donald Trump has predicted that Brexit will be "very, very good" for Ireland. But during a brief media appearance at Shannon Airport, the US President had to be corrected by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar as he seemed to suggest Ireland wanted a border. "I think it'll all work out very well for you, with your wall, your border. We have a border situation in the United States, and you have one over here," Mr Trump said. Mr Varadkar interrupted briefly to remind him: "The thing we want to avoid, of course, is a border or a wall."

He acknowledged the border question is "a big point of contention with respect to Brexit". I think they’re fans of Ireland pic.twitter.com/0EzjUwvuxJ "The big thing is going to be your border. Hopefully that will work out. I think it will work out. "There's a lot of good minds thinking about how to do it. It's going to be just fine," he said. The president, who touched down in Ireland shortly before 5pm, denied any knowledge of recent criticism of his climate change policy by President Michael D Higgins. He batted away questions about climate action, saying America has the "best air quality in the world".

He said relations between the two countries are "as good as it's ever been, maybe better". "We have millions of Irish and I think I know most of them because they are my friends," Mr Trump said. The Irish Government want to use the meeting with Mr Trump to push for progress on the issue of E3 visas.

Major efforts have been made to extend the right to Irish citizens but it was blocked by just one Republican senator, Tom Cotton.

If we get a unanimous vote, we do something that we've been trying to do for a long time. I want to do it for the people of Ireland but I want to do it better in the United States," he said. Mr Trump was asked whether his visit to Ireland was essentially a PR exercise for his hotel in Doonbeg. He denied this was the case, insisting he was here because of the special relationship between Ireland and the United States. "This trip is really about great relationships that we have with the UK and I really wanted to do this stop in Ireland because of the relationship I have with the people and with your prime minister," he said.

Afterwards, Mr Varadkar told reporters: "He's the president of America. There are nearly 200 countries in the world. I don't think it's possible for him to have an in-depth and detailed understanding of all the issues in every single country, which is why the engagement is important." Mr Varadkar said Mr Trump had heard from a lot of politicians in the UK who are in favour of Brexit and heard "a certain story from them".

Mr Trump acknowledged that the Irish border is a "sticking point" but said he believes it can remain open. "He didn't go into any particular detail for how he thinks it can be done," the Taoiseach said. The President also failed to elaborate during the private meeting on why he believes Brexit will ultimately be good for Ireland. Mr Varadkar has also defended the €10m cost for security during the visit. "I do think Shannon and Co Clare are good places to visit. I think that's a good message going to America." He added: "Much more important than security costs is the relationship between Ireland and the United States. A massive economic power. A massive political power. The good bilateral relationship between Ireland and America is worth a lot more than €10m." Security At a press conference at Shannon town earlier, Chief Superintendent Michael Gubbins said they have 1,500 members on the ground for the duration of Trump's visit. He said it was “quite a large operation” and that the last time they had one of this scale was the visit of former US President George Bush in 2004. Inside the Strategic Control Centre set up especially at the Garda station in Shannon, which is being manned on a 24 hour basis, officers were keeping a close eye on large screens showing CCTV footage from cameras at Doonbeg Golf Resort, Shannon airport and approaching roads. About a dozen additional cameras had been installed especially for the duration of the visit by President Trump. They also have access to a live feed from the Garda helicopter when Airforce One arrives. Another map on screen showed the location of all the Garda radios on the ground. Superintendent Liam Geraghty of the Garda Press Office said they have human rights advisers, tactical advisers on fire arms and a negotiators advisers all on site. Meanwhile on the outskirts of Shannon airport, the Peace Camp for protesters hung several banners reading “US war machine out of Shannon” on the bridges approaching the airport. Donald Trump will host a brief press conference before he travels to Doonbeg with his wife for a private dinner this evening. Online Editors
