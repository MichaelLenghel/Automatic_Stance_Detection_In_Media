Rapper Kanye West, with a stream of consciousness speech in the Oval Office and a burst of profanity, defended his support for President Donald Trump on Thursday, to the great delight of Trump himself. The event was billed as a lunch at the White House to discuss prison reform, jobs for African-Americans and Chicago violence. Those items were addressed in a pre-lunch meeting, but Kanye launched into a speech and Trump let him go on as the cameras recorded it all.  


 Kanye spoke of alternative universes, a new plane that Trump should consider as his next Air Force One, his diagnosis of bipolar disorder that he said was actually sleep deprivation, and living in a household dominated by females given his marriage to reality TV star Kim Kardashian West. Kanye later said his 10-minute speech was "from the soul, I just channeled it." Trump lapped it all up. "That was quite something," said Trump, who was joined in the Oval Office by Hall of Fame NFL running back Jim Brown, who smiled and sat quietly through most of event. Kanye came to the White House clearly with a lot on his mind, chiefly his support for the president. Kanye's visit follows by several months a similar trip to the White House Kim Kardashian West, who met with Trump on May 30 and persuaded him to grant clemency to Alice Johnson, who was serving a life sentence for a nonviolent drug charge in Tennessee. Here are 10 bizarre things he said. "I had the balls to put on this hat," the 41-year-old artist said in defending the red "Make America Great Again" hat that he wore for his meeting.

What I need Saturday Night Live to improve on, what I need the liberals to improve on: if he don't look good, we don't look good. "This is our president. He has to be the freshest, the flyest. "The flyest planes. The best factories. And we have to make our core be in power, we have to bring jobs into America. Because our best export is entertainment and ideas, but when we make everything in China and not in America, then we're cheating on our country."

I love everyone, but the campaign 'I'm with her' just didn't make me feel as a guy… it was something about this hat that made me feel like Superman." "One of the moves I love that liberals try do; A liberal would try to control a black person through the concept of racism because they know we're very proud, emotional people. "So when I said 'I like Trump' to someone that's liberal they'll say, 'Oh, but he's racist.' "You think racism can control me? Oh, that don't stop me. That's an invisible wall."
