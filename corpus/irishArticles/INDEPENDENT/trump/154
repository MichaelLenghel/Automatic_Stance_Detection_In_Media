And in Oregon, dozens of people blocked traffic in Portland causing delays for trains on two rail lines. Media reports said the crowd grew to about 300 people, including some who sat in the middle of a road. The crowd of anti-Trump protesters burned American flags and chanted, "That's not my president."

REUTERS/Max Whittaker/File Photo REUTERS / A representative of the Trump campaign could not be reached immediately for comment. About a fourth of the students from Miguel Contreras are members of the so-called "Dreamers" generation, children whose undocumented parents entered the United States with them illegally, school officials said, and fear of deportation under a Trump administration is a major concern. One of Trump's marquee campaign pledges was to build a wall along the border with Mexico to keep out undocumented immigrants and deport en masse those who immigrated illegally.

REUTERS/Mark Makela   REUTERS / After struggling for months with Mr Trump's takeover of their party, Republican leaders embraced the businessman in victory. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who was lukewarm in his support throughout the campaign, praised him for pulling off "the most incredible political feat I have seen in my lifetime". Mr Ryan said: "He just earned a mandate." Indeed, Mr Trump will take office in January with Congress fully in his party's control, giving him strength to try to pass his agenda and turn the Supreme Court in a conservative direction.

REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni REUTERS / Even Republicans were stunned by the scope of their electoral success, including many who had been privately predicting Mr Trump's defeat.

She said the crushing loss was "painful and it will be for a long time" and acknowledged that the nation was "more divided than we thought".
