The Miss Universe Organisation, which also runs the "Miss USA" pageant, was a joint venture between Trump and Comcast Corp's NBCUniversal. NBC Universal cut ties with Trump and the "Miss Universe" and "Miss USA" pageants in June after the real estate magnate and TV personality said that some Mexican immigrants are rapists and killers.

Trump is scheduled to appear on Jimmy Fallon's late-night talk show on NBC later on Friday.  Read here:    Reuters
