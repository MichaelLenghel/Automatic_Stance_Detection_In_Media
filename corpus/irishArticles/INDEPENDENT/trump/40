Most people, when ordering a £50, 28 day dry-aged steak would want to savour the unique taste and get their money's worth. Though, as we're all aware, President Donald Trump is not most people. Donald Trump likes his steak well done. Plenty of people like their steak well done and, by itself, this isn't really anything of note. But, in true Donald Trump form, he has to go one step further and has turned what originally started as a fairly average meal into nothing short of an abomination. Not only does Trump like his steak extremely well done, he also allegedly likes it slathered in ketchup.  According to the Independent Journal Review while dining at BLT Steak by David Burke with Nigel Farage, Trump ordered: "A well-done steak. An aged New York strip. He ate it with catsup as he always does." Twitter, understandably, was outraged by Trump's questionable dining choices but, in the grand scheme of things, eating well done steak with ketchup isn't even the weirdest thing Trump has done when it comes to food. Eating KFC with a knife and fork, inventing items on the McDonald's menu, and skinning pizza before eating it, here are just a few of the times Trump has managed to turn the simple task of eating into something so much more...   Fried chicken

Trump eating KFC with...a knife a fork

 Trump eating KFC with...a knife a fork / In what was presumably an attempt to convince the rest of us mere mortals that his incredibly privileged life means nothing and that he is just like the rest of us, Trump once posted an image on Twitter of him tucking into a bucket of KFC. Sadly, whatever press aide concocted this brilliant plan to make Trump more likeable neglected to send him a memo informing him that KFC supposed to be eaten with your fingers until they're slick enough with grease that you can see your own, mildly disgusted reflection staring right back at you. It may be a bit of a stretch to state that Trump is a fan of KFC, but he did once describe it as "not the worst thing in the world" which is...something at least.   Pizza toppings  via GIPHY via GIPHY Trump's love of pizza has been fairly well documented over the years. Do a quick YouTube search and you'll find advertisements from the 90s and early 2000s of Trump singing the praises of high-street pizza brands and, more recently, making a spectacle of himself on the internet (once again) by using a knife and fork to eat a slice. Trumps explanation for his bizarre pizza eating habits? "I don't walk around with forks and knives and, frankly it was very comfortable. Plus this way you can take the top of the pizza off and you're not just eating the crust. I like not to eat the crust so we keep the weight down at least as good as possible." Which is a dramatic policy U-turn, considering he appeared in the first TV ads for Pizza Hut's Stuffed Crust.

 Eating pizza with a fork and five other weird eating habits  / There you have it. Not only does Trump apparently skin the pizza before eating, he also, for some reason I can't quite make out, doesn't think it's possible to simply avoid eating the crust without the use of a knife and fork. Either Trump's staff are involved in an extremely elaborate and amusing game of 'How Weird Can We Make Our Boss Look Before He Notices' or Trump genuinely doesn't know how to eat with his hands. Both seem like perfectly plausible options.   Very fried eggs Everyone knows breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Everyone except Trump who actually goes out of his way to avoid it. Speaking to Fox News in 2016 he said: "If I can avoid breakfast, in terms of that, I will have a lunch but my big thing is dinner. Breakfast, Jesse, if I can avoid it, I'm very happy to do that." On the rare occasion he does eat in the morning he keeps away from caffeine and instead indulges in either cereal or bacon and eggs. And, in true Donald Trump form, he has a special way of cooking his breakfast that most people would probably balk at: "I love bacon and eggs...Bacon medium and the eggs over-well." That's eggs fried, flipped, fried again, flipped once more, and then fried again. No runny yolk. So sad!   Fish Delight

 Filet-o-What? CREDIT: GETTY / Despite being a staple on the McDonald's menu since the early 60s, and arguably one of the best features on it, apparently millennials aren't all that familiar with the Filet-o-Fish. But never fear millennials, because it turns out you're not alone. Leader of the Free World, Donald J. Trump, doesn't know what a Filet-o-Fish is. Technically.  At a press conference in 2016 he was asked to answer some "fun" quick-fire questions from a journalist. One of the questions involved fast-food chains and, obviously continuing on his foolhardy quest to seem like your Average Joe, Trump revealed he "enjoys the Fish Delight at McDonald's." A simple and harmless answer to a simple and harmless question, right? Well yes, except the Fish Delight doesn't actually exist.  We have to assume Trump meant the Filet-o-Fish, a piece of breaded fish fillet, topped with cheese and tartar sauce on a grilled bun, or maybe he has access to a secret menu there rest of us aren't privy to and the Fish Delight really does exist...   Meatloaf sandwiches

 Martha Stewart helps Donald and Melania Trump prepare his favourite sandwich CREDIT: MARTHASTEWART.COM / If you're ever invited to a picnic with Trump, make sure to pack a meatloaf sandwich because it's his favourite. Allegedly, on his birthday, his sister even will make him a special meatloaf using the Trump secret recipe. While Trump's eating habits when it comes to meatloaf aren't that strange, his insistence on making those around him eat it is a little odd. According to Tom Barrack, a longtime friend of Trump's, he is making all his friends who visit the White House try his favourite dish. Jersey Governor Chris Christie also confirmed this, giving the White House kitchen's meatloaf a stamp of approval: "This is what it's like to be with Trump. He says 'there's the menu, you guys order whatever you want,' and then he says 'Chris, you and I are going to have the meatloaf.' The meatloaf was good."   Pork chop lollipops

 Trump scoffing a pork lolly / Furthering the 'Donald Trump Doesn't Know How To Eat With His Hands' agenda, here we look at Trump's love of foods skewered on a stick. Not kebabs - that would be too normal - but great big slabs of meat pierced with a wooden stick for Trump to gnaw on the way you might enjoy a lollipop. Apparently pork on a stick is a specialty in Iowa, where Trump is pictured eating, but it's still a little odd. Telegraph.co.uk
