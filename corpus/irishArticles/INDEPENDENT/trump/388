Further protests are to be staged against Donald Trump as his UK visit turns from talks with Theresa May and the Queen to golf at his Turnberry resort. The US president apologised to Mrs May on Friday over an incendiary interview criticising her premiership, and hailed UK-US relations as the "highest level of special". While tens of thousands of protesters staged demonstrations across the UK against Mr Trump's views and politics, he met the Queen at Windsor Castle as the official part of his whirlwind visit to the UK drew to a close. On Friday night he flew on Air Force One to Glasgow Prestwick Airport in Scotland for a two-day private stay at his famous Turnberry golf resort but protests are expected to continue on Saturday.

Campaigners will also gather outside the Trump International Golf Links in Balmedie, Aberdeenshire, on Saturday, and it is predicted there could be further demonstrations at Turnberry. Greenpeace flew a paraglider with a banner message saying "Trump Well Below Par" above the resort on Friday evening. Ben Stewart, from the campaign group, said: "Theresa May should not have dignified Trump with a visit to the UK. The vast majority of British people are appalled by his words and deeds. He is, simply, the worst president ever. That's why we flew over him with a message branding him well below par."

The Prime Minister said the United States is "keen" to do a deal with the UK. "We will do a trade deal with them and with others around the rest of the world," she added. PA Media
