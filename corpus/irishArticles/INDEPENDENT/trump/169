President-elect Donald Trump held a 90-minute meeting on Thursday with U.S. President Barack Obama in the White House to discuss the transition of power after the Republican's stunning election victory. And the meeting, which lasted longer than expected, was followed up by a grand tour of the Trump family's new home, the White House. Donald Trump and his wife Melania were shown around the presidential mansion, with vice-president elect Mike Pence in tow. The couple, who have a 10-year-old son named Barron together, were led to the Speaker's Balcony on Capitol Hill to be shown the views of the Mall in front of them.

There should be plenty of room to sleep in the 132-room White House, but some have noted that Trump's move to Washington DC could be a downgrade from his already-luxurious lifestyle.  The Independent noted that Trump may have to downgrade to Marine One and Air Force One, leaving his own Boeing jet and helicopters parked up for security reasons.
