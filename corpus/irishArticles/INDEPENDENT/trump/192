Ivanka Trump is making sure her transition to Washington is a luxurious one.

While Kushner is a senior adviser in the White House, Ivanka's official role is not yet known, although it's reported she'll be filling in for first lady Melania (who will remain in NYC with her 10-year-old son Barron) and is her father's most trusted adviser. The couple, with a combined net worth of an estimated $200m, have offiically moved into their $5.5m home in the plush neighbourhood of Kalorama neighbourhood - just a few doors down from the Obamas.  Trump and Kushner still own their $10m penthouse in Manhattan, but will be spending the majority of their time near the White House.  Their six-bedroom, 6,870-square-foot house was built in 1923 and features a five wood-burning fireplaces and walk-in closets. It has five wood-burning fireplaces.
