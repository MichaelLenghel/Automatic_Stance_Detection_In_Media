IAWS chief executive Owen Killian was by far the best-rewarded chief executive on the stock market in 2007. The bagel baker landed a €10.15m package, according to the latest annual report. The top 10 best-paid Irish plc chief executives shared a total potential payout of almost €66.2m in salary, bonuses, options and conditional incentive schemes. This represents a staggering increase of 27 per cent on last year, when the top 10 bosses shared €52m. While Mr Killian's plain vanilla pay of salary, bonus, pension payments and benefits jumped from €1.17m up to €1.6m, thanks to a hefty bonus, it was the conditional award of 500,000 shares worth €8.55m under his long-term incentive scheme that really catapulted his pay into the stratosphere. Mr Killian was conditionally awarded 500,000 shares under two separate executive incentive schemes, the IAWS matching plan and the Employee Equity Participation Scheme. These shares awards will vest subject to Mr Killian hitting certain performance targets over the next two years. Last year Mr Killian's total compensation of almost €6.5m was boosted by stock option grants and profits from exercising stock options. Killian's entire package was valued at about €800,000 more than the second-best-paid chief executive. Kingspan's Gene Murtagh got almost €9.3m, despite the company's share price tumbling by almost 50 per cent. Mr Murtagh's basic wage of salary, cash bonus, pension payments and benefits rose almost €400,000 to €1.26m. But the biggest increase to his wealth was from profits generated by exercising stock options, which netted him €4.7m. Mr Murtagh was also conditionally granted almost 94,000 options, worth nearly €1.8m on the date of grant. Under Kingspan's long-term incentive plan, he made a profit of just over €1.1m on exercising other stock options, as well as €400,000 on further options. Last year, for the first time, the Sunday Independent updated its method of calculating executive pay for our annual survey. This now includes conditional stock option awards, deferred share grants, profits made on exercising options and awards under corporate bonus plans. This is the same methodology used by the likes of global wire services PA and US corporate bible Businessweek. CRH boss Liam O'Mahony was pegged at nearly €11.8m last year, through options awards and trading. This year, the outgoing CRH chief executive barely scraped into the top 10 list, with earnings of €4.4m placing him in last position. Mr O'Mahony's basic remuneration of almost €2.8m, increased by just 5 per cent on 2006. He also waived a €631,000 pension top up. Tom Hill, the CRH executive, tipped to replace Mr O'Mahony earned €4.66m through a combination of stock option awards and €1.67m basic pay. Irish Continental Group boss Eamon Rothwell made massive gains exercising stock options last year, to bring his overall pay to €7.03m. Mr Rothwell's basic pay of €1.42m was up from €1m in 2006, with his performance bonus of €953,000 making up most of his wage. Mr Rothwell made €2.4m exercising options at super-low prices and was also granted a further €3.2m worth of options. Elan chief Kelly Martin's €6.87m package is once again bulked up by €6.2m in stock options. The pharmaceutical boss also waived his cash bonus in return for stock options. Mr Martin's non-stock-based remuneration was only slightly up on 2006, earning him €1.23m -- before the bonus was waived. Since year end, Mr Martin has been awarded another €5.2m worth of options. Bank of Ireland's Brian Goggin was given €6.75m in pay and options. Bank of Ireland has a different financial year to most other companies, so Mr Goggin's pay for the year to March 2007 predates the credit crunch. Anglo Irish Bank is traditionally a high payer for its executive team. Chief executive David Drumm was rewarded with a deal worth €5.59m in basic pay and conditional stock options. He made €2.3m from exercising cheap options. However, Mr Drumm's package is once again dwarfed by his finance chief Willie McAteer, who passed the €6.4m mark. This options-inflated sum was down from €7.48m last year. Mr McAteer made nearly €5m in stock options profit. Smurfit Kappa chief executive Gary McGann received at least €6.16m. The actual amount could be higher. Mr McGann and two other executives shared a €5.3m bonus for floating the company. In calculating McGann's salary, we have divided this payment equally between the three; in all likelihood Mr McGann may have got a bigger share. His basic pay of €2.6m was €19,000 more than a year earlier. He was also given a conditional grant of convertible shares worth €1.8m.
