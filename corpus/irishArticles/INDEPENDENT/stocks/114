US stocks closed mixed as technology companies took their worst loss in six weeks, but energy companies rose with oil prices.  A four-day winning streak for the S&P 500 index ended. Energy companies rallied as the price of US crude oil rose almost 2%.  Smaller companies fell – like technology companies, they have done far better than the rest of the market in the last few weeks.  Some stocks that have struggled lately, including utilities, finished with gains. Household goods makers also broke from their recent losses to finish higher.  J.M. Smucker dropped after issuing a weak quarterly report and a disappointing forecast for the year.  
 Tech has been a source of strength lately, but today is leading stocks down #StraightFromTheFloor pic.twitter.com/wvXP9p9SWc Bond prices climbed and yields dipped. Quincy Krosby, the chief market strategist at Prudential Financial, said investors were playing it safe as they wait for leaders of the Group of Seven to meet on Friday and Saturday, and for European Central Bank and Federal Reserve meetings next week. “This G-7 meeting does not follow the historical template,” she said.  “The market is concerned about tariffs, negative trade dialogue coming from that meeting.” Still, Ms Krosby said it is a good sign that investors were willing to take some of their winnings from the technology sector and put it into other parts of the market. The S&P 500 index lost 1.98 points, or 0.1%, to 2770.37.  The Dow Jones industrial average picked up 95.02 points, or 0.4%, to 25241.41, helped by big gains for McDonald’s and Chevron. The Nasdaq composite slumped 54.17 points, or 0.7%, to 7635.07.  The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks slid 8.17 points, or 0.5%, to 1667.77.  Both of those indexes set all-time highs the last few days. More stocks rose than fell on the New York Stock Exchange. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the US government has reached a deal with Chinese telecommunications giant ZTE that includes a one billion dollar fine, monitoring and leadership changes.  ZTE has already paid about one billion dollars for selling equipment to North Korea and Iran in violation of US sanctions.  In April the department blocked ZTE from importing any US components for seven years, which threatened to put the company out of business. The Wall Street Journal said that with the ZTE matter settled, China’s government will likely approve a deal for Qualcomm to buy NXP Semiconductors.  Qualcomm added 1.3% to 60.64 dollars and NXP rose 4.8% to 120.07 dollars. Technology stocks have fared far better than the rest of the market for more than a year, but they broke from that pattern on Thursday.  Facebook lost 1.7% to 188.18 dollars and Microsoft fell 1.6% to 100.88 dollars.  Chipmaker Lam Research shed 5.4% to 188.83 dollars. Smucker’s profit and sales fell short of analyst estimates, as did the company’s forecasts for the new fiscal year.  The maker of jams, jellies and other foods said it is facing difficulties including higher raw materials and freight costs and rising interest rates.  The stock lost 5.4% to 100.80 dollars. Allergan jumped 5.1% to 163.27 dollars after Bloomberg News reported that investor Carl Icahn bought a small stake in the Botox maker.  Bloomberg had no details on Mr Icahn’s plans, but he could join other activist investors who are pushing the company to make bigger changes. At the end of May the company finished a strategic review and said it could sell its infectious disease and women’s health businesses.  But on Tuesday, Senator Investment Group and Appaloosa sent Allergan a letter saying they were “underwhelmed”, and they suggested splitting Allergan’s CEO and chairman roles and making changes to its board.  Allergan stock is down 28% over the last 12 months. Germany’s Dax lost 0.1% and the CAC 40 in France slid 0.2%.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 0.9% while the Kospi in South Korea finished up 0.7% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index advanced 0.8%. PA Media
