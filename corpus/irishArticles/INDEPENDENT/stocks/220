IT HAS been said many times that nitrogen is the key to driving the dairy industry. In other words, nitrogen is the key to growing enough high quality cheap material to feed our cows. I haven't seen any farm in Ireland yet where the cow's diet is totally made up of 100pc grazed grass. A number of you will have achieved 80pc of the figure and some of you may have gone even higher. But soil type and weather pattern play a major role. Will you still be able to grow enough of the high quality grass we have been used to, now that the levels you have been spreading will be reduced under the Nitrates Directive? The directive comes into law tomorrow and the nitrogen levels specified in the directive become the legal maximum amount of bagged nitrogen you can spread in the years ahead. What is the legal maximum amount of bagged nitrogen you can now spread? Well, like the advice given in pre-Nitrates Directive days, the amount you spread is totally dependent on the stocking rate. However, some of the terminology has changed. Previously when I wrote about nitrogen fertiliser recommendations, I was giving the advice based on stocking rate and the amounts mentioned, while specific, were guidelines based on research. Now, however, one can't talk about guidelines any more. The words maximum allowable are printed all over SI No 788 of 2005 (i.e. the Nitrates Directive) and the figures quoted are the legal limits. So, what are the maximum amounts of bagged nitrogen you will legally be obliged not to exceed (see Table). I know the Table looks and is complicated enough, but there is no way to make it any simpler and at the same time retain the message. A few important points. The stocking rate refers to the overall whole farm stocking rate, not just the cow grazing area. It also refers to all the land one farms and the figures also include the nitrogen spread on the silage area. I should also point out that the figures quoted are where slurry utilisation efficiency is at 30pc and that there is no organic manure imported onto the farm. The Nitrates Directive sets a ceiling of 170kgs on the amount of organic nitrogen one can apply. This equates to a stocking rate of 2 LU/ha (85kgs of organic N/dairy cow). The Table indicates the total amount of bagged nitrogen one can apply and the volume and approximate months when the nitrogen should go on. The second last column in the Table tells you that you can spread 158kgs/ha (126 units/ac) of chemical nitrogen. The previous recommendation for this stocking rate was 170kgs (136 units). This is 12kgs/ha (10 units/ac) less than the old figure. Funnily enough, if you increased the loading of organic N to 171kgs (2.01 LU/ha), one could apply a further 26kgs (21 units/ac), but then again, you would now be over the 170kgs and you might just need a derogation! While there is a difference of 12kgs/ha (10 units/ac) between the 2005 figure and the 2006 figures, by the time one reaches a stocking rate of 2.47 LU/ha (1.0 LU/ac) or an organic N loading of 210kgs, the gap between the 2005 figures and the figures in the Nitrates Directive are reduced to 6kgs of N/ha (5 units/ac). However, if one goes above a stocking rate of 2.48 LU/ha (1 cow/ac or 211kgs of organic N), the volume of nitrogen one is allowed apply is reduced by 10kgs (8 units/ac). At 250kgs organic N (2.94 LU/ha, or 0.84 acres per livestock unit), the amount of bagged N one can apply is reduced further to 243kgs (194 units). Clearly it is going to be very difficult to farm (i.e. grow enough grass) at a level greater than 2.47 LU/ha (1 cow/ac). This last statement may impact on some farmers who have a small land base around the house for the dairy operation and I am assuming of course that they don't have any outside land either owned or rented. What will be the effect at farm level? Let's look at 40ha (100ac) farms stocked at two different stocking rates, i.e. 2.47 cows/ha and 2.0 cows/ha. In 2005, at 2.47 LU/ha, the bagged nitrogen application figure was 290kgs/ha. This amounts to 11,600 kgs of N in total. If CAN only is purchased, a total of 43t of CAN (11,600 divided by 270) is needed. Under the Nitrates Directive, a total of 11,360kgs (284kgs x 40ha) can only be used. Again, if CAN only is purchased, a total of 42t (11,360 divided by 270) will be required, a difference of 1t, or 2pc. For cows stocked at 2 LU/ha (1.25ac/cow), the nitrogen application was 170kgs in 2005. This amounts to 6,800kgs or 25.1t of CAN. Under the Nitrates Directive, a total of 6,320kgs (158kgs x 40ha) can only be used. Again if CAN is the fertiliser of choice, a total of 23.4t can be spread. This is a difference of 1.7t (35 50kg bags). This is a reduction of 7pc in bagged nitrogen. It will take no small increase in productivity to grow the same amount of grass as heretofore to sustain this stocking rate.
