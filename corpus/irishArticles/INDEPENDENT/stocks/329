Overview THE Dublin market made further progress yesterday but there were plenty of sellers active in the market and the ISEQ made only limited progress, failing to make back much more of Wednesday's 4pc slump as it edged ahead by just 0.69pc or 63.22 points at 9228.11. Banks Banking stocks were weak across Europe and there was evidence that some investors are making a switch between Allied and Bank of Ireland yesterday. By the close Allied, traditionally the stronger of the big two, had been sold down in considerable volume, with over five million shares changing hands the stock drifted backwards throughout the session. At the close the shares were marked down 35c or 1.5pc at ?21.81 with the last offer in the market slightly higher, at ?21.95. Bank of Ireland had an altogether better session, with its stock trading up sharply late in the day, closing ahead by 50c or 3pc at ?17.25. Construction It has been a pretty volatile week for CRH and there was more of the same yesterday. After the stock enjoyed a strong 23c rise to ?30.10 on the opening bell, sellers came out in force and by the end of the session more than four million shares had changed hands with progress limited to just a 0.37pc or 11c rise to ?29.98. The rest of the construction sector was pretty poor as investors appear more than a tad concerned at the pace of building activity going forward - both here and in the US. Housebuilder Abbey shed 13c while DIY giant Grafton was 16c or 1.38pc off at ?11.40 by the close. Insulation specialist Kingspan was also in the red, closing down 10c at ?18.60. Food and drink C&C was one of the main features with an 8pc surge on the back of renewed takeover speculation. At the finish the stock was marked up 85c or 8.67pc at ?10.65. Other groups in this space were in demand also, with Kerry closing 37c or 1.78pc higher, Glanbia up 2c or 0.54pc and IAWS 25c or 1.5pc to the good at ?16.95. London The Footsie held firm after two days of extremes on a day where firms at the centre of takeover activity headed the risers board. The FTSE 100 Index held on to its strong rally from Wednesday's major sell-off to close just 2.6 points in negative territory at 6130.6. Merger and acquisition activity drove the tobacco sector up the risers' board with Imperial Tobacco nearly 5pc higher, up 108p at 2330p, and British American Tobacco ahead 34p at 1596p amid hopes for consolidation in the sector. Imperial also gained from broker upgrades following the announcement of the offer, while recent rumours have suggested that British American Tobacco and buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts are eyeing a move for the European operator. Investors also took a punt on consumer products group Unilever today amid speculation it may follow the break-up lead of Cadbury Schweppes. Europe European stock markets closed slightly lower in a volatile session, with banks and oil firms among the biggest losers, while takeover talk boosted shares including consumer products firm Unilever. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index ended down 0.08pc at an unofficial 1,454.8 below the day's high of 1,462.1 but above a low of 1,447.2. Earlier, stocks trimmed losses after US core consumer prices, excluding food and energy, came in line with estimates. For the week, the pan-European benchmark lost 2.3pc, hit by worries of financial contagion from troubled US mortgage lenders. New York US stocks dipped as worries over a possible spread of the crisis in the subprime mortgage market hurt financial and housing stocks and signs of rising inflation dashed hopes for interest rate cuts. Major investment banks were trading lower, despite strong results reported this week by Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc, and Bear Stearns Co Inc. Home builder shares were also broadly lower. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 54.80 points, or 0.45pc at 12,104.88 and the Nasdaq Composite Index was down 13.91 points, or 0.58pc at 2,364.79. US Treasury debt prices were little changed as the impact of a weaker stock market offset surprisingly high readings on inflation and industrial output. Commodities Commodity markets shrugged off concerns about a sharp slowdown in the United States. US light crude oil ticked higher but remained below $58 a barrel. Gold Gold pared earlier gains of around one percent as the latest buying spree, aided by a drop in the value of the dollar, fizzled out when prices neared $655. Forex On the foreign currency markets the dollar dropped to three-month lows on concerns the growing crisis in the US subprime mortgage industry could spread and hit economic growth. After rising to highs around $1.3340, the euro settled at $1.3315. PAT BOYLE
