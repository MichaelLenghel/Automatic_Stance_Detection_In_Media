IN A further sign that dot.com mania may be abating, techie stocks took a tumble on the Dublin market yesterday. The Dublin market echoed the US and UK markets where investors yesterday abandoned `new economy' stocks to give `old economy' stocks a long-awaited boost as the Dow posted a 500 point gain. At close of business in Dublin, Iona Technologies, the software company headed by multimillionaire Chris Horn, fell 17.6pc to euro 72.42. The plunge eroded a substantial portion of Iona's gains this year, but still left the stock up 42pc since January. Riverdeep, the educational software provider chaired by Pat McDonagh, fell for the fourth day to close down 6pc at euro 7.75. The recently floated company is now 25pc off its record high of euro 9.75 leaving Mr McDonagh's newly-acquired billionaire status in doubt. Irish-owned but London-quoted Baltimore Technologies closed down at stg£107.50 compared with stg£120 the previous day and well off its 2000 high of stg£137.50. The Irish market took its cue from the UK and the US where investors yesterday piled in to traditional stocks. In London, the FTSE 100 closed higher boosted by bank stocks and other old economy shares, while telecom, media and technology shares fell. Shares in internet travel agency Lastminute.com were among the casualties falling back to their flotation price, only two days after joining the market. The FTSE closed up 110.2 points or 1.7pc at 6,557.2, with gainers in a two-to-one majority. In the US, the Dow Jones benefited from the change of heart surging towards its best two-day performance since October 1987, as investors turned to financial, drug and industrial stocks. ``Some of the wall flowers are dancing again,'' Richard Babson, chairman and president of Babson-United Investment Advisors Inc. in Watertown, Mass., said of the blue chips' rally. The Dow Jones closed at 10630, up 5pc on the day, adding to Wednesday's 3.3pc gain. The tehcnology-laden Nasdaq index closed at 4717, up 2.9pc after a choppy session in which it alternately fell and rose. At its lowest point yesterday the Nasdaq's four-day drop touched 11pc. * Meanwhile, holders of bank shares breathed a sigh of relief yesterday as the switch out of technology stocks inspired a long overdue bounce in ``old economy'' shares. It remains to be seen whether this week's decline in the high-tech and internet driven Nasdaq market in the US is just a temporary blip or whether it spells a fundamental return to ``value''. Bank of Ireland did best of the Irish, closing 53 or 9pc higher at euro 6.30, someway off the day's best level. AIB gained 4pc and Irish Life & Permanent rose by 7.4pc. As yet this is a very modest rally. AIB remain 22pc off since the start of 2000; Bank of Ireland has shed one fifth of its end 1999 value, while IL&P has fallen 15pc.
