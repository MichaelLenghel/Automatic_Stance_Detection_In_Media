Overview THERE was further slippage on the Dublin market yesterday as the 10,000 barrier started to look a bit remote. After crashing through this historic mark on Wednesday, the market has taken stock and as one broker put it "the market crossed the line, got a but dizzy and stepped back". By the close the ISEQ Index was off by 24.35 points at 9910.36, ploughing its own furrow on a day that saw other European markets close higher. Financial It was a mixed day for the banks, with Bank of Ireland up and its major rivals onthe slide. While BOI posted a 4c rise AIB fell marginally by 5c and IL&P was one of the day's biggest fallers. Construction News from the US was not good for CRH last week, with a dip in home starts weighing heavily on the sector. A hangover effect was evident yesterday, the stock suffering a 33c decline. The rest of the sector was stronger however as there were rises at both housebuilders Abbey and McInerney as well as Grafton and Kingspan. Aviation A good day for the national carrier ended with the stock posting a 2c rise at ?2.87. This came after a denial that Ryanair, which was down 5c at ?12.35, is set to increase its bid and confirmation the EU has extended the deadline for its examination of Ryanair's bid to June 13. Leisure News that the UK chancellor is to try and tempt offshore bookmakers back to the UK put the focus on some of Paddy Power's big on-line rivals and the net effect was a 30c drop in Power's stock to ?17.85. UTV was back in strong demand though reports of stake building last month have yet to be confirmed. The stock was up 6.39pc or 41c at ?6.83, the best performance of the day. Figures out in the UK show that cider clearances in 2006 rose by 18pc on the prior year while beer was down by 3.2pc. The upshot is that cider's market share is up 1.9pc to 11.9pc, a record and very good news for C&C which closed the session 27c to the good at ?11.82. London Strong gold and oil prices anchored the London market in positive territory, despite heavy losses from Lloyds TSB and a negative opening on Wall Street. The FTSE 100 Index held firm to close up 20.6 points at 6401.5, despite a 3pc fall from the banking giant. Lloyds TSB shares closed down 21p at 592p after its full year results disappointed investors amid a surge in bad debts. The group banked profits of £3.71 billion in 2006 - up 8pc on the year previously - but worried the City with its cautious comments on the outlook for the current year. Oil stocks were higher after gains in oil prices with BP up 14p at 535p, Royal Dutch Shell ahead 28p at 1702p, Cairn Energy 26p higher at 1600p and BG Group closing up 7.5p at 718p. Power station Drax set the pace in the top flight, up 23.5p at 739.5p, amid speculation that it could attract private equity bid interest. And signs of a strongly performing property market buoyed shares in blue-chip housebuilder Persimmon and building materials firm Hanson - up 26p at 1424p and 8p at 853p respectively. Europe European stocks ended the session a touch higher as lacklustre banking stocks were offset by gains in miners and oil producers as worries about Iran helped nudge crude higher. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares closed unofficially up 0.2pc at 1,542.5 points. US US stocks fell for a third consecutive session as a further rise in oil prices stirred concerns about inflation and clouded the outlook for corporate profits. Worries over rising defaults in the subprime mortgage industry also led to a sell-off in financial shares, which sent the S&P Financial index to its biggest slide in nearly more than a month. Shares of Bank of America, the second largest-US bank, slid 1.6pc and were the top drag on the S&P 500, followed by Microsoft. Commodities Oil climbed above $61 to its highest level this year after top fuel consumer the United States reported an unexpected drop in gasoline stocks and Iran said it would show "no weakness" over its nuclear program. US crude was up 12 cents at $61.07 a barrel taking gains for the week to $3.66 or 6.3pc. Some analysts had said a close above $60.80 could presage further gains. Spot gold was at $685.70, a fresh nine-month peak as investors piled in, worried about global security risks and rising oil prices.
