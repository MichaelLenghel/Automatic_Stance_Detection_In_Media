STOCK markets around the world soared yesterday. In Dublin £2.1bn was added to the price of shares as the market rose by 6pc one of the biggest gains it has ever made in one day. The Irish ISEQ index of shares surged by 226.36 points to close at 3993.82 but was still well below its high in April of 5471.61 points. While stockbrokers were pleased at the enormous jump in share prices, few were willing to predict that it was the beginning of a sustained recovery after weeks of plunging shares. One Irish trader said: ``We have seen extraordinary volatility; we have never seen a period like it. On a value basis, this market is the cheapest it has been for a long time.'' But he pointed out: ``The rise is very focused on leading stocks outside the top six trading was very muted.'' Another trader said: ``Financials lead the way partly as a result of the interest rate cut.'' In New York traders said the rally was little more than an oversold bounce after the recent bashing stocks have taken. Jonathan Dodd, a technical analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter: ``Until we see some good back-to-back days and get the breath to go with it, the rallies will be shortlived.'' American brokers are anxiously watching to see how fourth quarter and first quarter 1999 earnings will to shape up. For many US stocks, the third quarter earnings season which has just kicked off is expected to be the worst in seven years. More substantial moves by Japan to tackle its banking crisis and further cuts in interest rates by the US Federal Reserve, which has already been factored into stocks, is expected to help sentiment. ``A lot of the bearishness is already built into the market which is looking beyond our current problems, but there will be a rocky road for the next few weeks before a year-end bounce back,'' said Mr Dodd. Last night the Dow Jones closed up 102 points at 8001. In London the FTSE-100 Index of leading shares made its biggest ever daily points rise as it surged through the key psychological 5,000 barrier on a wave of international optimism. A powerful gain on the Dow Jones Industrial Average index during the afternoon added to strong overnight performances in the Far East which saw Tokyo's Nikkei index put on more than 5pc in value, while the Hang Seng also saw steady gains. All across Europe stock markets made strong gains of an average of 5.75pc. Germany's benchmark Xetra DAX index advanced more than 7pc as a robust dollar and a solid performance on Asian stock markets lifted sentiment. The DAX-30 index closed at 4225.49 points, up 241.84 or 6.07pc. In Paris stocks held onto gains of 5.51pc at close of trade market cheered by strong Asian performances and early rally on Wall Street. The CAC-40 index closed at 3263.32 points, up 170.42. Dutch shares ended strongly, but 900-hurdle was too hard to take. Dealers foresee further rises for the coming days with some players seen covering short positions which could push the AEX index above the 1,000-level closing up 5.70pc. FTSE edges over 5,000 barrier The Footsie ended up 4.4pc with a rise of 214.2 points, closing at 5037.6. This added around stg£37bn to the value of shares on the index.  But as can been seen from our graphic, the bounce yesterday still leaves the FTSE index of leading shares substantially below the high of well over 6,000 points it achieved April of this year when Dublin also reached its peak.
