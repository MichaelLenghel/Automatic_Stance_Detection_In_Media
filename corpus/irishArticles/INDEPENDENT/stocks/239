TUMBLING banking and construction-related stocks resulted in the Irish stock market posting its most torrid five-day performance in six-and-a-half years. The sell-off capped five straight weeks of declines on the Dublin bourse. The Iseq Overall Index lost 1.4pc yesterday to bring its sell-off for the week to 8.2pc. The last time it fared so badly was when Elan led the market sharply lower in February 2002 after issuing a profit warning. Financial stocks were out of sorts once again last week, rattled as Standard & Poor's, the credit agency, downgraded its rating on Irish Life & Permanent and its ratings outlooks on the other three listed banks. Further tales of woe from the UK property market and news that US private equity fund Texas Pacific Group has pulled out of an agreement to invest more than £179m (€226m) in Bradford & Bingley to shore up the British lender's finances. Allied Irish Banks lost 8pc to €9.20, while Bank of Ireland sank 11.4pc to €5.18, Anglo Irish Bank plunged 16.1pc to €5.45 and IL&P tumbled 19.3pc to €5.95. Recession IL&P came out during the week partly attributing the woes in the banking sector to a recent report from the Economic & Social Research Institute, which signalled that the Irish economy is set to fall into a recession this year for the first time in a quarter of a decade. CRH also suffered its biggest single-day slump in 18 years this week after the building materials giant warned its profits should fall by a "high single digit" per cent this year as a result of ongoing economic weakness in America and western Europe. It also expects the dollar's ongoing weakness against the euro to shave €80m off its profits in 2008. A strong rally over the past two days after the stock's 12.6pc sell-off on Wednesday, left CRH's losses for the week at 6.9pc. Analysts also slashed earnings forecasts for the group. News that Taylor Wimpey has failed to agree the terms of an emergency fundraising with its shareholders wiped 35pc off McInerney's stock price to close yesterday at 37c. The group is now valued at a discount to the €84m it raised in a 'rights issue' stock sale last year. Abbey fell 14pc to €3.37. Shares in bookmaker Paddy Power added 2.8pc to €19.00 yesterday after they were upgraded to "buy" from a previous "neutral" rating by Goldman Sachs. The broker also added the stock to its "Conviction Buy" list. However, the stock ended the week as a whole in negative territory. Bucking the trend, Glanbia rose 5.9pc to €4.92 after the company said it is on course to meet analysts' estimates for 2008 after a "good" first half. Kerry Group also advanced. Smurfit Kappa lost 10.7pc to €4.55, dented by news Spanish paper packaging group SAICA is seeking planning permission to build a 400,000-tonne containerboard plant. The fear is that the machine, in addition to other planned new capacity elsewhere in Europe, will throw the tentative balance between supply and demand for cardboard boxes out of kilter. Aer Lingus slumped 15pc to €1.24. It is believed property developer Liam Carroll sold a large block of shares this week. A fresh surge in oil prices to a new record of $145.85 a barrel during the week also sapped investors' appetite for airline stocks. Ryanair fell 11pc to €2.41. National benchmark indexes fell in 17 of the 18 western European markets. Germany's DAX 30 lost 1.3pc. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 slid 1.2pc and France's CAC 40 slipped 1.8pc. Cautious "We're remaining cautious on banks for the moment,'' said Alain Bokobza, a Paris-based strategist at Societe Generale SA. "What's putting the brakes on the market is the oil price." Banco Santander, Spain's biggest bank, lost 4.3pc after Goldman Sachs downgraded the shares to "neutral" from "buy". European banks may need to raise as much as €90bn to keep their financial ratios at current levels amid a decline in credit markets, Goldman said. Swedbank, the largest bank in the Baltic states, dropped 5.7pc as the same broker lowered its recommendation for the shares to "sell". Bradford & Bingley fell 18pc, the lowest since its initial public offering in December 2000, after Texas Pacific Group withdrew £179m. British Airways dropped 5.7pc, Air France-KLM declined 1.7pc and Lufthansa retreated 1.5pc. Continental, Europe's second-largest tyremaker, fell 5.1pc. "The focus is still very much strongly on the oil price because inflation is mainly driven by the oil price," said Bernd Meyer, head of pan-European equity strategy at Deutsche Bank. Marks & Spencer lost 3.8pc. Citigroup downgraded the retailer to "sell" from "buy" as consumer spending slips.
