Stock markets were roiled by signs of a global trade war, with China poised to retaliate after US president Donald Trump’s administration planned to introduce tariffs on the Asian giant’s imports. The FTSE 100 ended the day down 0.4% or 30.65 points at 6,921.94, but fared better than European peers including the French Cac 40 and German Dax which fell 1.4% and 1.7%, respectively. It followed a major drop in Asian stocks overnight, when the Hang Seng Index slumped 2.4% and Japan’s Nikkei 225 tumbled 4.5%. American stock indexes also fell into the red at the start of trading. This is only the beginning of the economic standoff between the two largest economies in the world and investors are jitteryDavid Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets David Madden, a market analyst at CMC Markets, said: “Beijing is hitting back at the US in a measured way, as China looks to impose tariffs on approximately three billion US dollars worth of US imports. “Given the US will be slapping levies on 50 billion US dollars worth of Chinese imports, it was a fairly tame response from China. “This is only the beginning of the economic standoff between the two largest economies in the world, and investors are jittery.” In currency markets, the pound was mixed, rising 0.3% against the US dollar to 1.414 and falling 0.1% versus the euro to 1.144. Brent crude prices rose 1.5% to around 69.88 US dollars per barrel – its highest level since late January – after Saudi Arabia’s energy minister signalled that Opec production cuts could be extended into 2019.
