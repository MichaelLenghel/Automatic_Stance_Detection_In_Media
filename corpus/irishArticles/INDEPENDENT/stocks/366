THE impact of reducing stocking density to comply with the 210kg/ha nitrates  directive limit for organic N could reduce incomes on very intensive farms by 10-20pc. Sean Regan presented the findings of a new Teagasc study (Lally and Riordan 2003) on the economic impact of the directive on the 30 specialist dairy farms above 2.5LU/ha in the 2001 Teagasc National Farm Survey. The farms were divided into four stocking rate (LU/ha) categories: 2.5-2.6, 2.6-2.7, 2.7-2.9 and 2.9. The average reduction in farm income arising from reducing the stocking rate to 2.5LU/ha was found to be 1pc, 3pc, 4pc and 11pc, respectively. The study concluded that the impact of reducing stocking rates would be greatest on intensive dairy farms where dairy cows account for over 70pc of total livestock units and stocking rates are in excess of 2.9LU/ha. However, a very small number of farms would have to reduce dairy cow numbers rather than livestock to comply and this could reduce their income by more than 20pc. Farmers could potentially reduce the severity of the stocking rate ceiling by increasing milk yield and reducing cow numbers. This assumes that the standard organic N excretion level of 85kg/annum for average yielding dairy cows can be retained for higher merit cows but the scientific evidence suggest that this position can be defended. Lally and Riordan also looked at chemical nitrogen use and found average application rates of 281kg/ha. That is below the Teagasc advice of 320kg/ha for the average stocking rate (2.67LU/ha) but matched the advice (280kg/ha) for 2.5LU/ha. This indicated that chemical N restriction would not be a problem on average. However, six of the farms in the highest stocking rate capacity ( 2.9LU/ha) applied chemical N in the range of 300 to 480kg/ha and the authors point out that this latter rate is considered to be in excess of what is sustainable from both an agronomic and environmental viewpoint.
