THE IRISH Stock Market yesterday soared to an all-time high for the second day in a row. The ISEQ index of shares jumped 1.6pc, consolidating the impressive 3.35pc gain on Monday. The new peak was helped particularly by strong demand from overseas investors, which pushed Irish Life, AIB and Bank of Ireland to new highs. Dealers said there was no sign of the market's rise coming to an end, as interest in Irish stocks was based on the continuing stream of good news about the economy. The Central Bank yesterday indicated that money market interest rates look set to decline which is good news for companies' profits. Dealers said that the bull run was also being helped by the healthy bond market, which is continuing to converge with German yields. Prices on the stock market have also been pushed upwards as there has been a lack of Irish sellers but many potential investors have been keen to snap up stocks and this has created a squeeze in liquidity. The Irish market yesterday managed to buck the trend of world markets. In London, the FTSE-100 index of top shares remained almost unchanged as the US Dow Jones fell back by 1pc at one stage. HEALTHY IRISH ECONOMY Further weakness in the Irish pound, which yesterday fell sharply for the second day in a row, has also made Irish shares more attractive. One dealer said that overseas investors were anxious to get exposure to the healthy Irish economy. The best way to get good exposure is to invest in financial stocks like the two big banks. The ISEQ index rose 68.85 points to close at 4259.45 points, pushing up the stock market's capitalisation by £425m. AIB rose 11p to 743p, while Bank of Ireland came close to breaking the £6bn market capitalisation barrier and gained 10p to finish at 1160p. Irish Life, which until now has been slow to benefit from the recent stock market rises, jumped 24.5p to close at 432.5p and Anglo Irish Bank climbed by 4p to 145p. Non-financial stocks also enjoyed gains in the market as Smurfit rose by 4p to close at 208p, Kingspan gained 6p to finish at 240p and IFG Group gained 4p to end at 77p. Hibernian rose by 5p to finish at 530p, Jurys gained 3p to close at 415p, Waterford Wedgwood was up 5p at 100p and DCC rose by 3p to 465p. In the rest of Europe, the picture was mixed as German shares finished trade weaker in Frankfurt after consolidation in the wake of a two-day rally. The market was 0.7pc down. In Paris, shares bumped down from a run of euphoric sessions, a widely expected consolidation aggravated by sliding index-heavy oil stocks, leaving the CAC-40 index down 1.14pc.  In Tokyo, stocks ended down due to bearish sentiment fuelled by yen weakness, even though ministers said they would try to boost the market and the economy. The 225-share Nikkei average closed down 0.4pc.
