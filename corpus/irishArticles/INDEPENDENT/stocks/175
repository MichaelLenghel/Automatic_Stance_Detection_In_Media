NICK WEBB CRH boss Liam O'Mahony was by far the top-paid boss of all Irish listed companies last year. O'Mahony took home a gross package of almost ?11.8m split between salary, bonuses and stock option gains. This equates to over ?32,000 per day. The top 10 highest earning executives of companies quoted on the stock market last year breached the ?52m mark, or an average of ?5.2m. O'Mahony pocketed ?2.66m as a salary, bonus and assorted benefits package. However, most of his riches came through a stock option hand-out, worth ?4.06m on the date of the award. He also earned a ?3.56m profit from exercising other stock options. The cement tycoon is also in line for a near ?1.49m share award under the CRH performance share plan scheme. The full remuneration level of public company executives has never been fully assessed before, with just salaries and bonuses usually considered. However, new executive compensation calculation methods which include overall stock option awards and gains made by exercising options are now widely used by the likes of global news service PA and American business bible Forbes Magazine. For the first time, the Sunday Independent has applied these criteria to reveal the true extent of the earnings made by key executives in public companies. The findings may surprise you. Anglo Irish Bank's low-key finance chief Willie McAteer ended up taking home more than his boss last year, with an overall compensation package kicking in at almost ?7.48m. While his basic pay and bonus amounted to nearly ?1.78m, McAteer hit paydirt with his stock options package. During the year, he exercised 475,000 options at ?1.18 each when Anglo Irish Bank was trading at ?13.18, making a ?5.7m gross profit. Another surprise entry was IAWS chief executive Owen Killian who was awarded over ?6.4m, based on the new calculation criteria. The croissant conveyor had a slightly smaller basic package of ?1.176m last year, down from ?1.19m in 2005. However, he was granted 296,000 options at an average price of ?12.62 (worth about ?3.73m). He would have to pay to exercise these options. Killian exercised 160,000 other options netting a ?1.2m gross profit by the end of the year. IAWS also bought ?300,000 worth of stock for Killian as part of its incentive scheme. Bank of Ireland, the country's second largest bank awarded chief executive Brian Goggin a potential ?5.85m for the year in salary, bonuses, conditional share awards and options gains. His basic salary and bonus jumped from ?1.92m in 2005 up to ?2.525m in the year to March 2006. Subject to hitting performance targets, Goggin was conditionally awarded shares worth ?1.62m at the time. The bank chief made a ?707,000 profit exercising options during the year and was granted options worth almost ?996,000 when awarded. The value of these stocks has increased dramatically since then but all our calculations are based on share prices at the time of the transactions. Down in Ballsbridge, AIB head Eugene Sheehy had a package valued at up to ?4.58m. This was split between a standard salary, bonus and benefits lump of ?2.436m which was fattened up by a potential ?1.9m award of shares under the bank's long-term incentive scheme, as well as profits from exercising stock options during the year. Anglo Irish Bank's chief executive David Drumm would have topped the pay list if calculations had been based purely on salaries, benefits and bonuses. Last year, he was paid ?3.015m - up from ?2.35m a year earlier. However, his earnings were boosted by a near ?1.5m gain from exercising stock options during the year. Again, these shares would be worth far more now, based on Anglo's share price. Another shock entry was that of Grafton's low-key chief financial officer Colm O Nuallain. The DIY chain and builders' providers paid O Nuallain more than its executive chairman Michael Chadwick. O Nuallain's basic package was worth ?942,000 in 2006 - but he was also awarded options worth ?1.38m on the date of the grant. Tullow Oil's Lamborghini-driving boss Aidan Heavey was up to ?2.82m better off after a transformational year at the resources company. His basic earnings, converted from sterling, amounted to more than ?1.6m. This was augmented by performance-based share awards worth a potential ?1.1m when granted, plus shares granted under a deferred bonus scheme. Paddy Power may only be the 21st biggest company on the stock market, with a market cap of just over ?1bn - but it paid chief executive Patrick Kennedy more than the likes of Top 10 firm bosses Michael O'Leary, Irish Life & Permanent's David Went, Elan's Kelly Martin, Kerry Group's Hugh Friel and C&C's Maurice Pratt. Kennedy trousered a standard salary, bonus and benefits combo worth nearly ?1.25m - but he was also granted options worth just over ?1m. Since then the value of those options has rocketed on the back of an extraordinary share price surge. Outgoing IL&P boss David Went was up ?2.16m for the year, based on the latest annual report. Most of this was made up of a ?1.335m wage and bonuses, with the rest coming from Went exercising about four blocks of stock options for a profit of about ?830,000 at the time.
