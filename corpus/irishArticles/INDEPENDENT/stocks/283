THE FTSE-100 Index of leading stocks fell dramatically in the first hour of trading yesterday when a keying error by a  European brokerage house pulled down the market. Within the first 15 minutes of trading, the FTSE fell 208.6 points to 6392.1 after the error led to shares in 23 stocks being suspended. It is understood that a member firm selling 102 stocks made the keying error at 8.14am. Small errors, such as a misplaced decimal point or extra zero on a share price, can lead to such incidents. If individual stock trades at 5pc more or less than its previous price, the exchange's system is alerted. The mistake was quickly spotted and the 23 stocks were suspended for five minutes to allow the shares to recover. During the day's trading the market clawed its way back after the plunge, and by mid-morning much of its lost ground had been recovered. By the end of trading the FTSE was down just 18.7 points at 6,582.0. A spokesperson for the London Stock Exchange said that all unusual share movements would be looked into by them. Chief executive of the Irish Stock Exchange Tom Healy said that while these sort of things happen occasionally, there were alerts in place in the system here should anything go wrong. He said that when the error was righted, all stocks should return to normal. Yesterday's error comes at an inopportune time for the London Stock Exchange which is already facing widespread criticism in Britain over plans to merge with the German stock exchange, as other bidders emerge including a firm bid from Sweden. There was further embarrassment for the London Stock Exchange when four people including two former employees faced criminal proceedings yesterday. They were charged with offences related to insider dealing. The exchange has declined to comment.
