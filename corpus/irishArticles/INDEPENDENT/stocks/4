Make the sambos, roll up the blanket and pack the basket... here's Fran Power's list of Ireland's Top 30 picnic spots. For landscape variety - and a choice of isolated beaches - it's hard to beat Ards Forest Park on 480 hectares of salt marsh, saltwater lake and woodland stretched along Donegal's Sheep Haven Point. Trails suited to buggy riders or hikers take you past umpteen spots to unwrap the sangers, but one of the best leads along the edge of Binngorm Point with views out across Sheep Haven Bay.
