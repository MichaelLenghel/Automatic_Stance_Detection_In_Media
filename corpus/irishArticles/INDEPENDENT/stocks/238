Dublin stocks suffered losses for the fifth day on the trot as sentiment continued to weigh heavily on the market. There was a short rally in the morning, but investors see these as more of a cue to start selling than any strength in the market. "The sentiment is still very, very bad. Investors use brief recoveries like we've seen this morning to reduce their positions," said Thomas Radinger, fund manager of European stock at Pioneer Investments. CRH The Dublin market put in a one-hour rally this morning as investors were cheered by strong results from CRH, which reported full year results in-line with forecasts, if slightly disappointing. CRH stock reacted with a reasonable 1.4pc gain, closing up 33c at €24.03. Financial stocks were sold again, however, with Bank of Ireland dipping below the €9 mark at €8.91, and AIB down 3pc to €13.02 -- the main culprits in dragging the ISEQ Index 87.83 points lower to 6202.97 by the close. This brought its losses for the week to 450 points. Apart from CRH, there were few bright spots, but Paddy Power gained over 4pc after posting a good set of results on Monday. The stock closed well bid up 88c at €22.53. In London, the FTSE 100 Index suffered its fifth successive losing session as lower banking stocks and fears over higher oil prices heaped pressure on shares. The unease over the banking sector came amid downgrades for Citigroup, sent the banking giant's share price to nine-year lows. At the close, the Footsie was 50.9 points down at 5767.7. The benchmark index has now lost more than 300 points, or 5pc, in the past week. Banks HSBC and Halifax Bank of Scotland weighed on blue-chip stocks after a downgrade for the former from Goldman Sachs. It saw HSBC hand back gains seen on Monday after it posted solid full-year results with annual profits up 10pc to £12.2bn. The stock was down 21p to 769p after Collins Stewart and JP Morgan both reduced their price targets for the UK's biggest bank. HBOS was off 14.5p to 543.5p as the recent negative sentiment over the stock persisted, while Alliance & Leicester also fell 12.5p to 513p. Insurance The worst performer in London's top flight was insurance firm Admiral despite a 24pc rise in full-year profits to £182.1m for the Diamond and Bell owner. Shares tumbled almost 16pc, or 157p to 845p, as spooked investors focused on the performance of Confused.com, which struggled to maintain share in a competitive market. The gloom spread to other insurers and life firms. Friends Provident was down 3.4p to 123.6p, Royal & Sun Alliance lost 3.9p to 125.3p and Legal & General dropped 2.7p to 120.1p.
