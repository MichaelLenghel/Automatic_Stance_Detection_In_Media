This is the fifth in a series of six articles written by RORY GILLEN, Equity Analyst in NCB Stockbrokers, in which he outlines successful stock picking systems which have been developed and documented by recognised international stockmarket investors IN his 1996 best seller What works on Wall Street, James O'Shaughnessy documents the results of his back testing undertaken to determine which approach to stock picking produced the best results over the long term in the US. To quote the author himself: ``To make the best investment plans for the future, investors need access to unbiased, long-term performance results of how particular investment strategies performed historically.'' Well O'Shaughnessy certainly doesn't disappoint. The following are but a few extracts from his book. Over the long term, the market rewards stocks with low price-to-book value ratios (which represents a company's share price relative to its book value per share). $10,000 invested in the 25-50 stocks with the lowest price-to-book ratios on 31/12/51 (yes 1951) and turned over annually grew to $3.6m by 31/12/94, a compound return of 14.7% p.a. This compares to the S&P 500 index of stocks where $10,000 grew to $1.8m, a 12.8% compound return p.a. over the same period. A similar approach but with a focus on cashflow saw $10,000 invested on 31/12/51 in the 25-50 stocks with the lowest price-to-cashflow ratios (cashflow is defined as net income plus depreciation) and reviewed annually increased to $2.9m by the end of 1994, representing a compound return of 14.1% p.a. $10,000 invested in the 25-50 stocks with the lowest price-to-sales ratios (which is a simple measure of a company's market value relative to its turnover) on 31/12/51 and reviewed annually grew to $5.9m by 31/12/94, a compound return of 16% p.a. And what about stocks that did well the previous year? $10,000 invested on 31/12/51 in the 25-50 stocks with the largest price appreciation the previous year (or highest price relative strength) and turned over annually was worth $3.3m by end 1994, a compound return of 14.5% p.a. A couple of percentage points of outperformance per annum against the S&P 500 may not particularly impress readers but, over the long term, the awesome power of compounding makes an enormous difference. When one considers that 80% of the professional fund mangers in the US consistently under perform the S&P 500 index, the results of these strategies can be seen in an altogether different light. O'Shaughnessy went a stage further. He found that, by combining share price relative strength with value factors such as (price-to-earnings, price-to-book value, price-to-cashflow and price-to-sales), returns could be improved even further. Again the price-to-sales factor worked best. $10,000 invested on 31/12/51 in the 25-50 stocks with the best price appreciation in the previous year and with a price-to-sales ratio of below 1 (and turned over annually) grew to £14.1m by end 1994, a compound return of 18.4% p.a., 6% per annum ahead of the S&P 500. So why has combining these factors worked so well ? The relative share price strength gets you to buy the stocks just as the market is embracing them, while the low price-to-sales (earnings, cash or book value) constraint ensures that the stocks are still reasonably priced and, therefore, there is a high probability that their share price recovery has much further to go. In a follow-up book How to Retire Rich O'Shaughnessy details clearly how individuals can follow these approaches. In addition, his investment company operates a website (www.howtoretirerich.com) which details his approach and the historical returns delivered. The site is well worth a visit. Some of his funds (established in late 1996) under performed the market in 1998, most likely as a result of their smaller company bias. The following (Reasonable Runaways and Cornerstone Growth) are two systems he recommends and the table shows their performance relative to the S&P 500 over the last five decades. Both strategies outperformed the S&P 500 consistently with the under performance of Reasonable Runaways in the 1990s being the only exception. This under performance has occurred in the last two years (1997 and 1998). Reasonable Runaways. Market Cap greater than $150m Price-to-sales ratio less than 1. Select at least 25 shares that have also shown the best price appreciation in the previous year. Rerun the process yearly. Conerstone Growth Market Cap greater than $150m. Earnings higher than the previous year. Price-to-sales ratio of 1.5 or below. Select at least 25 stocks that have also shown the best price appreciation in the previous year. Rerun the process yearly.
