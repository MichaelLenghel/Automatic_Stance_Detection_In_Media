More than 40 sporting clubs,  community groups and schools across North and Mid-Cork are set to share in a more that €37million funding windfall under the latest round of the Sports Capital Programme (SCP).  A total of 42 local groups will between them share a substantial pot of more than €1.6 million for a wide range of projects encompassing a broad spectrum of sports and sporting interests. The allocated monies will be used to enhance existing facilities and fund new capital schemes that will, according to Sports Minister Shane Ross, allow as many people to participate in sport as possible.  "Increasing participation in sport is the central aim of our National Sports Policy and to achieve our objectives we need to have appropriate sports facilities," said Minister Ross.   "The vast majority of grants are going to voluntary organisations and I want to particularly thank all of the volunteers associated with these clubs for their tireless work and their commitment to improving their facilities to benefit all members," he added.  Sums ranging from just under €2,500 to more than €90,000 have been allocated to locals clubs, to help fund projects including news astro turf pitches, dressing rooms and toilets, gymnasiums, hurling walls, training facilities and the purchase of new equipment.   Some of the biggest local winners were Ballincollig GAA, which was allocated €94,057 for a '4G' pitch development; Mallow Utd AFC €90,037 for an artificial playing surface, fencing and lighting; Kilworth GAA €€83,606 for new dressing rooms/toilets; Glanworth Community Council €69,002 for a tennis court and Banteer Community Sportsfield, which received €71,547.   The latest round of funding under the initiative has been welcomed by local public representatives, including Fianna Fáil spokesperson for sport, Cork East TD Kevin O'Keeffe.  "Every Euro that is allocated ensures that our communities benefit enormously from the provision of facilities.  Every applicant works extremely hard to maintain its facilities and great recognition must be given to the committee's involved," said Deputy O'Keeffe.  "Not every applicant was successful so I would urge those to apply again when the next grant scheme is announced," he added.  Fine Gael's Cllr John Paul O'Shea said the funding would "have an  enormous impact on local sporting and community groups. "Sport is at the heart of every community in Ireland and this funding, which will new the development of new facilities and the purchase of new equipment, will serve to increase participation across a host of different sports," he said.
