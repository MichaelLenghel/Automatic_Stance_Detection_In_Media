The government has today announced grants of €56m to over 1,700 sporting projects around the country under the Sports Capital Programme.  A variety of sports teams, organisations and associations will be delighted this morning after getting financial help to upgrade services and build new projects. The highest grant given was for €150,000, which was awarded to 26 projects in Dublin. Twenty six counties were given grants, and 18 of the highest funded projects in each county were for GAA clubs. Some of the country's biggest GAA clubs will be upgrading their facilities, with All-Ireland club hurling semi-finalists Na Piarsaigh getting €80,000 to install floodlights. Announcing the funding, Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Shane Ross, said: “This is a great day for Irish sport. When we originally invited applications under the scheme, we had just €30m to allocate and the record level of applications would have left a large number of good projects unsupported and many clubs disappointed. Happily, following the conclusion of budget discussions, I was delighted to secure the required additional resources to enable me to allocate €56m in total to local sports clubs and organisations throughout the country. The grants are also excellent news for our communities both rural and urban, as club sport is a superb way to bolster local pride, affinity and inclusion.” You can see the complete list of the allocated funds here.
