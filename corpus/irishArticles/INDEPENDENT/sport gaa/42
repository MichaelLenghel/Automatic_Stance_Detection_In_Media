THIRTY-THREE sports groups in Kerry are to benefit to the tune of a combined total of almost £1.7 million from the Go By Emer Connolly THIRTY-THREE sports groups in Kerry are to benefit to the tune of a combined total of almost £1.7 million from the Government's national lottery funding announced last week. While GAA clubs around the county will reap the majority of the funding, representatives of minority sports, including Cahersiveen and Templenoe Rowing Clubs and Killorglin Athletics Club, have welcomed the allocations. Sports bodies in the county which are to receive the largest cut of the funding are An Ríocht Athletic Club in Castleisland (£250,000), while the Intermediate School in Killorglin will receive £200,000 towards the development of an all-weather pitch for the mid-Kerry area. An Ríocht will use its funding to build a club house adjacent to the track, which was opened a year ago. The club house will include toilets and changing rooms, which will, in turn, pave the way for the track to play host to major championships. Club treasurer Bill Costello said that the allocation of the money will lead to top class facilities being provided in Castleisland, including a jacuzzi, sauna and fitness area, which can be open to the public not only in the evenings, but also during the day. "We are delighted to receive this allocation. We have the track but no changing rooms and toilets and we needed this for the club, which we can turn from a six-month to a 12-month facility," he said. A site parallel to the town's Intermediate School has been earmarked for the pitch in Killorglin, which will serve the entire mid-Kerry area. "It is estimated that the project will cost £500,000 in total and the Government allocation will be welcomed by those who instigated the project in January. Complete with a synthetic grass surface, this full-sized pitch's high endurance surface means that sports like rugby, soccer, football, hurling and hockey could be played on it. Among the other sports groups in Kerry set to benefit substantially are Spa GAA club and Internazionale FC in Killorglin, both of which will receive £100,000 each. Kenmare Shamrocks hurling and football club will receive a grant of £75,000, as will Beaufort GAA club, Cahersiveen rowing club, and Fossa and Moyvane GAA clubs. In total, Kerry clubs will receive the sixth highest allocations granted to any county, behind Dublin, Cork, Kildare, Waterford and Donegal. The allocations for the 33 groups in Kerry is part of a £40 million funding package announced nationally by Tourism, Sport and Recreation Minister Jim McDaid, under the Sports Capital Programme. Some 679 projects nationwide are to receive grant aid. It is by far the largest ever allocation by the Government for sports and recreational projects and represents a £4 million or 11 per cent increase in funding over last year. The Government has this year given a special priority to the development of sports and recreational facilities in designated disadvantaged areas. The Kerry allocations are: An Riocht Athletic Club£250,000; Ballyheigue Community Centre £15,000; Beaufort GAA Club £75,000; Cahersiveen Rowing Club £75,000; Camp Community Council £20,000; Causeway GAA Club £25,000; Cordal GAA Club £20,000; Cromane GAA Club £25,000; Currow GAA Club £50,000; Derrynane GAA Club £10,000; Dr Crokes GAA Club £40,000; Fossa GAA Club £75,000; Glenbeigh/ Glencar GAA Club £30,000; Intermediate School Killorglin £200,000; Internazionale Kenmare FC£100,000; Keel GAA Club £20,000; Kenmare Shamrocks Hurling & Football Club £75,000; Kerins O'Rahilly's GAA Club £60,000; Kerry District League £40,000; Killorglin AFC £40,000; Kilmoyley GAA Club£15,000; Mastergeeha FC £15,000; Milltown/Castlemaine GAA Club £40,000; Moyvane GAA Club £75,000; Muckross Rowing Club £30,000; Na Gaeil CLG £45,000; O'Neills Crotta GAA Club £20,000; Scartaglen GAA Club £10,000; Sneem GAA Club£20,000, Spa GAA Club £100,000; St Brendan's Park FC£40,000; Templenoe Rowing Club £4,000; Waterville GAA Club £10,000.
