SLIGO/ LEITRIM Fine Gael Deputy John Perry has slammed the Governments proposals for Stadium Ireland. Deputy Perry claims that a possible £1 billion bill for the project is “totally unacceptable”, at a time when a total of £5,009,617 alone is needed to cover Sports Capital applications lodged for County Sligo with the Department of Tourism and Sport. “Sports policy should primarily be based on maximum participation levels, not ‘bums on seats’ in Stadium Ireland. This money could be spent on improving local facilities and fostering participation by greater numbers,” he said. Deputy Perry revealed that a total of £17,014,218 had been requested in Sports Capital applications for County Sligo for the years 1999, 2000 and 2001, with only £681,500 allocated over the past two years. “The Government proposes to spend £1 million per week every week for twenty years to bring expenditure on Stadium Ireland to £1 billion, while a large list of applications from County Sligo remain without funding,” he added. Deputy Perry said the figure for Stadium Ireland took no account of the on-going financial costs of running the complex. If the Olympic Stadium in Sydney was anything to go by, it would require enormous amounts of exchequer funds annually to keep it afloat, he maintained. “In this context, I believe it is madness in the extreme to spend £1 billion on Stadium Ireland when the most basic elements of a national sports infrastructure are absent at a local community level. “The Government cannot afford to jeopardise further development within County Sligo. Funding should start locally and it is ridiculous to spend such an extravagant amount of tax payers money on a Sports Stadium,” Deputy Perry said. According to figures supplied to Deputy Perry the following is the complete list of applications to and grants awarded under the Sports Capital Programme from County Sligo in the years 1999, 2000 and 2001.
