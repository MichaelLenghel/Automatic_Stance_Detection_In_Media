Like all major organisations, the GAA is quick to get up on its high horses as soon as criticism appears on the horizon. It was the same last week when the ESRI said it believed there was a relative decline in the numbers playing GAA games over the past 25 years. All the forces of GAA publicity were lined up to shoot the messenger. The ESRI actually said the GAA decline was relative to many other sports. What the ESRI tells us is that many people who had access only to GAA games 30 years ago now have far more options. So, there is no need for GAA fanatics to get their underwear in a twist. The GAA is as strong as ever but far more people now have the chance and the desire to engage in a diverse range of sports. Instead of whingeing about a report, the GAA should be working even harder to promote its own games at local level. Does the GAA ever ask itself, for instance, why in every county we have amalgamations of two or more clubs rather than a club in every parish? The biggest increase in sport is in individual sports. This is because many people do not want to be part of a team, with all the pressures it brings. The GAA, unfortunately, has no tradition of recreational sport -- playing games just for the fun of it. That attitude runs counter to everything the GAA stands for. No matter how insignificant the competition is, down to Division 5C, team mentors will browbeat players into a 'must-win' philosophy. Many do not want that cut-throat approach and leave to enjoy their sport elsewhere. This costs the GAA not alone players, but many potential administrators, as the association is constantly finding out. It is time the GAA made some attempt to encourage players of limited ability to play football or hurling just for the fun of it.
