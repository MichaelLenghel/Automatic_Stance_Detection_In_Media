Athletics: Lusk - Congratulations to our own Sinead Sharkey who was delighted to take part in the inaugural marathon of her home town Portadown. Sinead's time of 3:46:30 was good enough for third lady and was even more impressive considering it came only two weeks after she completed the Belfast Marathon.  Another of our new members, Garrett Loy, has also been busy since Belfast. Garrett started the weekend with a quick 21:56 at the Navan 6k on Friday night and followed that up with another speedy run of 18:14 at the Tallaght 5k on Sunday morning.   Garrett has already proved to be a massive asset to the club since his recent transfer from Portmarnock AC.  Well done also to Colm Donoghue who took part in the shot putt at last Wednesday's Dublin Graded Meeting in Tallaght.  The club is immensely proud of our young athletes who competed at the Leinster Schools Championships in Morton Stadium on Saturday.  Well done to Adam McNally who secured bronze in the pole vault, clearing 3m 60cm with a great attempt at 3m 80cm.   Congratulations to Grace Codd on her gold in the pole vault. She just missed out on a new championship record on the way. Very well done to Eabha McNally who also won gold in the Senior pole vault.  There was a great race by Kirsty Seaton, coming home fifth in the hurdles final, and finally Grace Codd took fourth in the triple jump. Overall, it was a wonderful day all round for our junior athletes.  Congratulations to all club members who took part in the Dublin County Athletic Board League 4 in Tallaght on Saturday. Thanks also to their coaches and volunteers.  Lusk club members were in action at six different parkrun events across Dublin over the weekend and there were some impressive results.   Conor Doyle was first finisher at the challenging Ardgillan course in a new personal best of 18:19. Claudio Rivelli was in second place at Malahide in 17:33, while Conor Clune came home in third at Donabate in 19:47.   Well done to all those who participated or volunteered.

This week's jackpot stands at €2,582.  Fingal Ravens There was a great win by the Dublin Minors last week, with our own lads Sean and Callum taking part.  Our U-14 girls played in the Feile at the weekend. While unsuccessful it was great to be involved. We congratulate and thank St Pat's for their great organising and hospitality. Many thanks to mentors Ger and Dave O'Connor and Mark Parkinson and James Bailey. Thanks also to Justlite and Mace who sponsored the gear for the team.  Following on from our hugely successful coaching workshop, presented by Darren Daly with top GAA coach Colm Nally back in March, we will now have a practical field session for club coaches. This will take place in Fingal Ravens on Monday June 10th at 7pm and will be hosted by Colm Nally who will do a field training session with a selection of our juvenile players.  This session is a MUST for all club coaches (and any aspiring coaches).  Congratulations to the eight Fingal Ravens lads involved in the Schools Leinster Final for Ashbourne CC.  Last week's lotto numbers were 13, 22, 25, 31 and the €20 prizes went to Joe Collins, Vinnie Convery and Phylis Kettle. This week's jackpot is €17,000.  Preparations for our fundraiser The OsKaRS are under way. Our large cast of actors/actresses have also the task of raising the money. This is a fundraiser that will benefit the club facilities for all involved in Fingal Ravens. I'm calling out for anyone who would like to sponsor or contribute in any way to any of the seven films.  The cast of films have organised some events. The 'Sister Act' cast would like to invite you all to a table quiz on Thursday May 30th at 8pm in Kettles, with table of four at €20. Come along for a fun night. The Forest Gump cast are having a Poker Classic on Thursday June 6th at 9pm sharp - €25 per entry.  Rest in Peace Anton O'Toole, affectionately known as the 'Blue Panther', a true Dublin legend. Condolences to Neasam Macionnraic and family on the passing of his father Diarmuid. Sympathies also to Pauline Kavanagh and her extended family on the passing of her stepmother Una Dennis. Peace be with them both.  St Finian's Swords What a beautiful time we had the weekend before last - and what a busy one, with two of our adult camogie players representing Dublin. Our Thomas Ashe U-13 boys played their first match and defeated St Sylvester's B 4-9 to 3-6. It was a great team performance by all the lads. Well done to all.    The U-13 girls football team had a fine win over Na Fianna at Collinstown Lane. Having lost out narrowly on the last day out against league leaders Westmanstown Gaels, they made amends on a scoreline of 7-18 to 0-5.  There were some fine performances all over the park, but notably up front where Aimee Timothy top-scored with 2-6. Anna Egan rivalled her with 3-2, as did Ella Keenan with 2-3. The referee's pick for Player of the Match was awarded jointly to both Anna and Ella. Keep up the good work girls.  Well done to Ciara Buchanan and Jules McDonald who both started for the Dublin Intermediate team to face Kildare in the Leinster Championship at  St Conleth's Park. Unfortunately, the full-time score was 2-6 to 1-6 to Kildare.   The U-12 St Finian's camogie team played St Jude's in River Valley. A slow start to the first half saw St Finians 2-2 to 0-0 down at half-time, and although fantastic second-half performance saw St Finian's a point up with a few minutes to go a late goal from St Jude's saw them home. Special mention to Ava Donnelly who was Player of the Week and also Gabrielle Church who bagged a hat-trick! Well done to the players involved - and to Alli Halpin who played a full match and then refereed the U-12 game excellently!!  There was a great effort from the Under-11 girls against a really strong Good Counsel team in Crumlin.  Our Under-10 girls were in action against Castleknock - a great performance by our girls.   Well done to all the U-9 boys who played against Fingallians - three great games and lots of skills and effort on show.  The U-9 girls were in camogie action away to O'Dwyer's. There was some very hard tackling and the girls are getting the hang of air camogie now, but there were sore shins on both sides afterwards!  Our U-8 girls camogie team played one of their more physical matches to date against St Sylvester's in Malahide. There were numerous knocks and bruises on both sides, but great display again of the skills the girls are developing each week.  Our U-8s had a great morning away to Donoghmore Ashbourne - well done to all the lads.  The St Finian's GAA Kelloggs Cul Camp will take place from July 1st to 5th.

Our Feile team won on a scoreline of 5-3 to 2-2 and there was more silverware for the club after our Minors won the Division 3 Camogie League on Sunday. Congratulations girls - very well deserved!  There was a good win by our adult hurlers in the league at home to Kevins.  Last week the club said goodbye to our GPO Vinny Whelan who after three years moves to a new role with the the LGFA in Croke Park.   We would like to thank Vinny for all his hard work, dedication and enthusiasm that he brought to the club over his three years with us and wish him all the best in the new role.    The 91st annual general meeting of St Maur's GAA will be held in the club this Friday at 8.30 pm.

The AFL9 team were defeated by St Finian's Swords. The Senior ladies lost out by a point to Parnells that week in the Intermediate Championship.
