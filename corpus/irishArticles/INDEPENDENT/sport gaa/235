Athletics Lusk - Congratulations to Fiona Reinhardt who became the latest member of Lusk AC to have completed a Marathon in 2018 when she took on the Wexford Marathon on Sunday. Fiona finished in a super PB time of 3hr 53min, running with husband and marathon veteran Gary. At midnight on Friday night Stephen Brennan set out on the incredible challenge of the Wicklow Way race. Stephen doesn't tend to do easy races, but this one was something else - 130km, including 4,000 metres of climb, with the extra obstacle of it being one of the hottest days of the year. Stephen gave it everything, but the heat ultimately cost him when he didn't reach the 108km checkpoint within the allotted time. It was still an amazing achievement of which he can be very proud. On Saturday, four of the club's ladies completed the Glenmore 10-mile challenge. This is a very hilly race, and so coupled with the heat it was a great performance by all. Special congratulations to Claire and Ger who were running their first 10-mile race. Results: Catriona Skelly 1:44:05, Claire Ryan Hogan 1:47:16, Michelle McGee 1:54:27, Geraldine McCartney 1:54:27. The club held its first 'paced miles' night last Tuesday at Rathmore Road and it proved to be a great success. Athletes were paced at a range of miles, from 10 minutes to six minutes. Thanks to all the pacers and organisers and well done to all those who ran. We will hold similar evenings later in the summer. The club bagged a fantastic medal haul in Santry on Wednesday evening, with no fewer than three podium places in the shot putt. Eleaina Gahan took gold in the Women's Senior Championship, while in the Men's Senior Championship Colm O'Donoghue picked up silver and Eamonn Gahan bronze. Well done all. Our club members stayed within the boundaries of north Dublin for their parkrun fix. Sixteen completed the 5k distance on Saturday in almost tropical heat across five venues. Conor Doyle was the first finisher at Ardgillan with a very impressive 19:37 and new PB. Sheila Bourke was first lady home at Donabate - and well done to Jamie Cruise who lowered his PB at River Valley to 20:33. Also running at River Valley was Eamonn Gahan who has now completed the full set of Fingal parkruns. Congratulations to Des McNally who reached the milestone of 50 parkruns with a good run at Father Collins. There were also PBs for Lorraine Doyle and Amy Hollands. A further nine ran at the Rush junior parkrun on Sunday, with Michael O'Reilly, Enda O'Reilly and Odhran O'Reilly all achieving PBs. Well done to all those who participated or volunteered. Results: Ardgillan - Conor Doyle 19:37 1st and PB, Colm De Bhal 22:11, Frankie Hollands 42:07, Amy Hollands 48:30 PB. Malahide - Orla Smith 23:33. Father Collins - Des McNally 23:16 (50th parkrun). River Valley - Jamie Cruise 20:33 PB, Eamonn Gahan 28:13. Donabate - Sheila Bourke 21:25 1st female, Rodrigo Lara 23:00, Liam Halpin 24:21, Olivier Ansaldi 24:41, Stephen Magee 27:59, Noreen Ansaldi 29:08, Lorraine Doyle 30:01 PB, Geraldine Halpin 30:58, Matt Wade 35:01. Rush junior - Cerys O'Mahony 9:42, Michael O'Reilly 10:46 PB, Niall Lenehan 10:47, Alexa Holland 11:00, Donnacha Lenehan 12:48, Enda O'Reilly 13:10 PB, Caleb Nolan 15:11, Aoife Clune 17:14, Odhran O'Reilly 17:50 PB.

From the juveniles who volunteered, the athletes who competed, the adults who officiated, the parents who supported coaches and kids - there was a community spirit that led to a third place overall in the games.  For some it was a day of victory, and while all athletes can be commended for the time, effort and dedication they put in, we have to applaud those that did medal.
