GAA players were the sixth most drug-tested sportsmen in Ireland last year, a statistic that is sure to raise eyebrows amongst the players' GPA union. The GPA recently contemplated refusing such tests in their bid to increase pressure for government grants but decided against it as a refusal to take a test is officially treated as failing one. As amateur athletes, GAA players resent having to undergo tests but they are among many unpaid sports who have to do so. They still also feel they need more education in the area and the GPA specified that in their list of demands to the GAA this week. And the Sports Council said yesterday that the appointment of a new education officer in their Anti-Doping Unit will allow them to undertake further work with the GAA. "Educating players is primarily the responsibility of a governing body," ISC CEO John Treacy stressed. "But we have undertaken, in partnership with the GAA, to do further work with their doctors and players in 2006. The players probably don't see it because of the inconvenience of testing but what anti-doping is all about is protecting the players and the integrity of their sport and the GAA accepts that," he added. The Sports Council tested the same amount of male GAA players (44) as they did soccer players in 2005. These numbers do not actually vary from 2004 but, given the large numbers of senior intercounty GAA players, it is proportionally small and only 12 tests were out-of-competition, in three visits to squad training sessions. Track and field athletes (131) remain by far the most tested sports species in the country, especially out-of-competition (104). Rowers are next (81), followed by cyclists (72) and rugby players (56), up from 40 last year. Rugby players were also subjected to additional tests ordered by the IRFU, IRB and Six Nations and it was one of only two sports tainted by a positive test last year. Ulster squad member Rowan Frost tested positive for cannabis in a Celtic League match last October and subsequently served a two-month ban. The only other positive in Ireland last year (by a visiting French squash player) was also for cannabis, a growing trend as five of the seven positives in 2004 were for so-called 'social drugs'. Last year's two positives are actually the lowest recorded since the ISC's anti-doping programme began. Such statistics raise questions about the need for such a stringent system which the ISC admits is now at maximum capacity and efficiency (815 tests) and one of the most vigilant in the world. The ISC stood over their strict regime and said last year's considerable drop in positives was no gaurantee that everything was perfect. In 2004 Ireland had two drug scandals; athlete Cathal Lombard and Waterford Crystal Treacy said that the trend internationally is that the first year after an Olympics always shows a significant drop in positives. In 2004 Ireland had two drug scandals; athlete Cathal Lombard and Cian O'Connor's Olympic gold-winning horse Waterford Crystal. One Irish sport producing a number of high-profile positive results is greyhound racing which, significantly, does not come under the Sports Council's remit. The industry's governing body Bord na gCon is undergoing a review by Tim Dalton. However, Minister for Sport John O'Donoghue said: "There has been some suggestion that the governing body and the regulatory body for its doping programme should be separate and that will be considered."
