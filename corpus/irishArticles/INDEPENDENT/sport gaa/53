They've spent hours braving the elements on the sidelines as they cheer on their other halves, but last night the GAA wives and girlfriends stole the show as they sauntered down the red carpet at the GPA All-Star Awards 2014.  Kerry footballer David Moran arrived with Sinead Keane on his arm, and she looked chic in a dramatic midnight blue number complete with plunging neckline and sweeping train. Christina Tangney arrived with James O'Donoghue and she looked a vision in a deep red gown with gentle cap sleeves and sequinned detail on the body. Ireland Under-19 soccer star Sarah Rowe, who arrived with Mayo footballer boyfriend Aidan O'Shea, also opted for a standout scarlet number. Hillary Donaghy, wife of Kerry footballer Kieran, looked timeless in a black frock with peplum detail on the waist. Anne Ryan, who arrived with Kilkenny hurler Richie Hogan, looked demure in a beaded dusty blue floor length gown. See Sport for full details of the All Star awards Irish Independent
