THEY may have secured the rights to GAA matches, but fans will be hoping Sky Sports have brushed up on their facts by the time the championship comes around. Sky Sports News gave a brief introduction to those unfamiliar with our games this evening, highlighting London’s impressive run in the 2013 campaign, though they got their wires a little crossed when announcing that Mayo finished the season as All-Ireland champions.  The embarrassing gaffe was immediately seized upon and circulated on social network sites within minutes of its utterance. In reality, Mayo and a dejected Chris Barrett were beaten by Dublin in last year's final and haven't won an All-Ireland since 1951 - a ropey start to the beginning of a new era for Sky Sports and the GAA. Ironically, the clip ends with the voiceover "If you're new to Gaelic Games", which it would appear Sky are.  Yesterday, the GAA announced that Sky Sports will now broadcast 14 live games as part of a new TV deal. The decision will mean that some Irish viewers will not have access to certain championship games, though Liam O’Neill said this evening that it was necessary to make the games a global sport, with millions in Britain having access to live championship games for the first time. O'Neill also highlighted the fact that viewers In Australia will be able to watch championship games for the first time for free.     Online Editors
