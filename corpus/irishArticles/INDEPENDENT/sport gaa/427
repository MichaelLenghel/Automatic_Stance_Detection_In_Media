Sky Sports have expressed their ‘disappointment’ surrounding Joe Brolly’s controversial comments regarding presenter Rachel Wyse. The outspoken RTE pundit earlier today apologised for his “crass” comments regarding Wyse, adding it was “wrong” and “not meant to be personal”. The former All-Ireland winner has been highly critical of the GAA's deal with Sky, describing the deal as "a breach of principle". However it was his comments on social media last night that sparked a furore. He tweeted: "SKY = TV3 plus Baywatch babe". He withdrew his comments today after stinging criticism, with Wyse saying she was aware of Brolly’s comments of late. When contacted, Sky Sports said they were disappointed with the comments and felt they were insulting not just to Wyse, but to women in broadcasting. "We were disappointed with his views and we note that he has subsequently apologised. Rachel is a highly-experienced journalist who will play a key part in our GAA coverage,” a spokesperson told Independent.ie.
