A number of sporting clubs in Dundalk and north Louth are set for a major boost after Sports Capital Grants were announced last week.  The biggest winner in the Dundalk area was Sean O'Mahony's who were awarded a€150,000 grant towards the construction of a much needed new dressing room complex at the club. Club chairman, Pat O'Brien said they were delighted to inform members and supporters that their application was successful. 'With this great news we can move forward with our plans to upgrade our existing facilities. When we first built our club rooms it was to cater for the limited numbers of members and players within our community.' He added: 'With the ever increasing numbers in both, it has meant our club must update and upgrade our facilities. Because of the substantial cost involved with this project we had to explore all options of funding.' He explained that one of the options open to them was the Sports Capital Programme, for which they had to meet strict criteria. 'Our application was then submitted by Declan Flood, Eamon Doyle, Anto Mackin and the Club Executive Committee.' 'The club would like to thank Declan for all the work he has put in up until now. He has been working non stop with the club to make sure we met and exceeded the criteria needed.' He also paid a special thanks to Peter Fitzpatrick TD. 'Peter met with us on several occasions to advise and guide us in relation to our application, this along with his lobbying of the government, and the Minister for Tourism and Sport ensured funding was secured on our behalf.' He added: 'With this funding we can look to the future with certainty, the certainty that our club and community can continue to grow, knowing that our facilities can accommodate the future generations of the 'Wee O'Mahony's'.' The second largest grant in north Louth was €99,000 awarded to Roche Emmets, which they club have said will go towards major redevelopment plans. A club spokesman said: 'A sub committee of the main Roche committee have been working tirelessly on this grant funding since the start of the year. The end result of all their time and effort has been awarded in the amount of €99,000. Well done lads and thank you from everyone at the club.' Meanwhile, Dundalk Gaels have benefitted from a substantial €91,000 grant, which is intended for a ravamp of security and for renewal of the pitch. Outside of GAA, a number of local soccer clubs were also celebrating after the grants were announced last week. Glenmuir FC, Hoey's Lane were granted €67,500 to replace their large all weather pitch which is the base for the club's busy academy set up and is also used by teams in the Dundalk Schoolboys League for training purposes, while Rock Celtic were successful in their bid, and were awarded €30,000 for the upgrading of floodlights. St. Dominic's (Friary Field) who last year carried out a complete drainage and seeding programme on the pitch, were granted €14,100 for sports equipment and ground maintenance. Announcing the funding of almost €1.6 million for sports clubs and organisations across Louth, Peter Fitzpatrick said: 'This is great news and a great boost for local communities.' It is very welcome that once again, Sports Capital funding is being provided to clubs and local organisations here in Louth and around the country.' He added that the funding has been awarded under the Sports Capital Programme through the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. Louth TD Fergus O'Dowd also welcomed the funding, saying: 'I am delighted for the local clubs and associations that have benefitted from this round of sports capital funding and the communities that they will ultimately benefit, I have been working hard with my local and national colleagues to support many of the projects in my constituency.' 'I have been highlighting the importance of the sports grant application to the clubs and organisations in Louth for some time now and I hope a further round of funding will be open for applications in the not to distant future.' 'The Sports Capital programme is the main channel of government support for developing sports facilities and purchasing sports equipment for sports clubs and organisations across Ireland." 'I hope that this funding will enable these clubs and organisations to go from strength to strength.' Meanwhile Louth TD Declan Breathnach added: 'Congratulations to all the sports clubs in Louth who were successful in getting funding under the Sports Capital Grant - sports and leisure clubs are the lifeblood of our communities.'   How Louth clubs benefited from the Sports Capital Grants Abaile Autism Support Louth & Meath Sports Equipment Special Needs €3,000 Ardee Celtic FC Equipment & 3G surface to existing pitch €35,500  Ardee St Marys Vision 2020 Development Plan €115,000  Aura Dundalk Swimming Club AURA Dundalk Swim Club equipment €4,500  Boyne AC Gym Equipment (Exercise Bicycles) €5,500  Cooley Kickhams GAA Equipment for new skating club €9,000  Dreadnots GFC Erection of BallStop Netting €22,000  Drogheda & District AC Floodlights installation €34,500  Drogheda Water Polo Club Drogheda WaterPolo Club Pool Equipment €1,400  Dundalk Cricket Club Dundalk Cricket Club facility & equipment upgrade €13,500 Dundalk Gaels GFC Revamp Dundalk Gaels GAA Securityand Renewal €91,000  Dundalk Sub Aqua Search and Recovery Boat Trailer and Equipment €49,000  Glen Emmets GFC Main pitch floodlighting/walkway €68,000  Glenmuir United FC All Weather Pitch Replacement €67,500  Haggardstown & Blackrock Comm Centre Engagementof Haggardstown and Blackrock Community €20,000  Holy Family Boxing and Community Centre New showers, toilets, dressing & upgrade facilities €94,500  Hunterstown Rovers GFC Upgrade existing pitch Install new all weather pitch €62,000  Ionad Na nDaoine An tShlanaitheora Teo Various Sports Equipment and a defibrillator €2,500 Irish Martial Arts Academy Martial Arts Equipment €18,000  Kilkerley Emmets GFC Improvements to cater for growing numbers and use €32,500  Louth Mavericks American Football Club Safety & Training Equipment / Club Owned Jerseys €8,500  Louth WATCH Club Tandem bikes, Cycling Helmets & Hi Vis Jackets €18,000  MacBride Pitch and Putt Club Course Equipment and Storage Shed upgrade €4,000  Mattock Rangers CLG Ballstop & Dressing Room Refurbishments €21,000  Naomh Malachi Walking track €24,000  O Connells GFC Refurbishment of old dressingrooms and garage €46,000  O’Hanlon Park Boxing Club Installation of timber floor in training area €15,000  Roche Emmets CLG Roche Emmets GFC redevelopment plans €99,000  Rock Celtic FC Floodlight Upgrade €30,000  Sean O’Mahonys GFC Proposed new dressingrooms to existing GAA Club €150,000  Slieve Foye Sub Aqua Club Replace Safety Eqpt, Buy new Dive/Snorkel/Medical €20,500  Square United AFC Square Utd AFC €11,590 St Joseph’s GFC Gym Equipment €4,500  St Nicholas GFC Club House and Changing Rooms Refurbishment €108,000  St Patrick’s GFC Rampark Development 2017 €79,000  St Dominics Football Club (FC) Sports Equipment and Ground Maintenance Equipment €14,116  St Fechins GAA Club Pitch Drainage and purchase of gang mower €24,000  St Kevins GAA Gym Equipment/Pitch Drainage & Security Fencing €63,000  St Oliver’ Scout Group Equipment for Physical Activities in Scouting €14,000 Stabannon Parnells GFC Floodlights with community walkway and new mower €105,000  Walshestown Juvenile Football Club Floodlight upgrade and Ball Catch Net installation €9,000  Woodview Celtic Grant for mower and pitch marker €3,000 The Argus
