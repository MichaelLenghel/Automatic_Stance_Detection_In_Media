A NEW drive to stop children getting hooked on drugs was announced yesterday as part of a major overhaul of the British Government's anti-drugs strategy. The £5 million-a-year confiscated from drug dealers will be spent on drug prevention programmes. And much of the £1.4 billion-a-year spent on fighting drugs will be reallocated from ``reactive'' enforcement and treatment schemes towards preventative education. ``Illegal drugs are now more widely available than ever before and children of all ages are increasingly exposed to them,'' Leader of the House of Commons Ann Taylor told MPs. ``A fresh long-term approach is needed to galvanise our efforts.'' Children aged from five to 16 will get ``appropriate'' drug education, although drugs ``czar'' Keith Hellawell promised this would not mean five-year-old being told about crack cocaine. Drug treatment and testing orders for criminals under which they agree to stay off drugs or face jail will be piloted in three areas across the country. And specific targets will be set to ensure the strategy is working. But Mr Hellawell, the UK Anti-Drugs Coordinator, admitted the Government could never eradicate drugs completely.  Research showed almost half of under-25s have used drugs, and half of all recorded crime had a drug-related element.
