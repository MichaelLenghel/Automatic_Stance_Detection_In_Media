Q : I've been prescribed a course of drugs but reading the label was frightening because there are so many side-effects. Is this normal? A: Side effects caused by drugs are common, with one leading survey revealing that more than 40pc of all patients receiving drugs suffer a reaction of some sort. Some are temporary and fairly minor, while others are permanent and dangerous. Certain side-effects happen quite frequently with specific types of drugs. The following list should give you a general idea of what to expect: Drowsiness: This is a common problem with sedatives, tranquillisers, sleeping pills, drugs used in the treatment of anxiety and depression, and drugs used in the treatment of epilepsy Drowsiness is also common with anti-histamines, so patients taking medication for hayfever should beware. Nausea and vomiting: Hormones, heart drugs, pain relievers and drugs used to treat infection are four of the common groups of drugs associated with these side-effects. Diarrhoea: Anti-infective drugs, such as penicillin, are often associated with diarrhoea, as are drugs used in the treatment of gastro-intestinal problems. Dry mouth: Drugs used in the treatment of high blood pressure and nervous problems can produce a dry mouth. Indigestion or wind: Pain relievers and drugs used to treat infection as well as steroids are particularly likely to cause these symptoms. Rash: Any drug can cause this, but antibiotics, such as penicillin and sulphonamide, are perhaps most commonly associated with this problem. Constipation: Common with pain killers, antacids, cough medicine and drugs used to treat diarrhoea.
