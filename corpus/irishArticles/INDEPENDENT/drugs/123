Another 13 people have been arrested over the prison escape of notorious Mexican drug capo Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman. The national Prosecutor's Office said 11 men and 2 women were arrested and taken to dufferent jails. It did not name the suspects but said they were detained in connection with the escape. Earlier this month a judge began proceedings against four officials including two intelligence service members and two prison control room employees. They were accused of aiding Guzman's July 11 escape through a tunnel dug to his cell. Proceedings were already under way against the person in charge of the control room and two prison guards. Guzman also escaped from another prison in 2001.  PA Media
