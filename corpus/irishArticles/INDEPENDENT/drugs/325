AS many as 52pc of Irish prisoners are drug users, says the  EU's drugs agency in Lisbon which has highlighted the major problem of drugs use in Europe's prisons. The EMCDAA (European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction) estimates the drug-using population in prisons here at between 30-52pc. In England and Wales the rate of drug using prisoners is 15-29pc, while Scotland puts it at 18-33pc. And the report says Ireland's methadone programme is inadequate. Here, prison policy is to provide the same level of drug substitution treatment (methadone) inside prison as outside, but in practice this does not happen, says the report. There is one detoxification unit and one, small maintenance clinic in Mountjoy prison, which has 20 places for 670 inmates. The report says says that a minimum of 180,000 and perhaps as many as 600,000 drug users pass through EU prisons each year. The drugs problem is especially acute among women and juvenile prisoners. The ratio of prisoners in the EU is 94 per 100,000 inhabitants, much lower than the 645 in the USA. In Ireland, the ratio is 79 per 100,000. The highest prison population, proportionally, are in Portugal (147), Scotland (118) and England/Wales (107). The proportion is lowest in Greece (51), Finland (56), Sweden (62) and Denmark (65). According to the report drug users inside prison do not have the same access to health services as those outside prison. The drugs agency also pinpoints big differences between EU member states in their treatment of drug users. The EMCDDA (European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction) published their findings in a special report. The report notes that no European country has a system to quantify the scale of the prison drugs problem. It claims that prisons provide an environment that sustains substance abuse among existing users and even fosters it in non-users. Austria appears to have the lowest proportion of users between 10 and 20pc of the prison population. At the other end of the scale, Portugal's estimate is 38-70pc. In France the rate is 32pc, Germany 20-30pc and Italy 25-29pc. Despite the major drug problems in all EU prisons, Germany and Spain are the only countries with needle exchange programmes inside their jails.
