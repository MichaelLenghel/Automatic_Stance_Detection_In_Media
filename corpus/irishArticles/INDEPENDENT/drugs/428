The number of gardaí committed to drug units across the country has tumbled since the beginning of the decade, despite a spike in drug crime. A small rise this year has not changed the overall trend since 2011 of a falling number of gardaí working in the units, which is down by more than a third in eight years. As of September, 232 gardaí - including inspectors and sergeants - were working in drug units across the country, an increase of 10 from last year and only the second since 2011. The last was in 2015 when four more officers joined the specialist units. Apart from these slight deviations, the general pattern since 2011 shows large falls in drug enforcement officers. Eight years ago, 359 gardaí formed the drug units nationwide. This has decreased to 253 in 2014, and 222 last year. In that period, the number of drugs unit gardaí in Dublin fell from 147 to just 80. Co Limerick lost half of the gardaí in its drugs units from 20 to 10, Cork City saw a decrease from 38 to 23, and the Kilkenny/Carlow region lost 75pc, going from eight members to two. Co Wicklow's drug unit decreased from 11 in 2011 to four this year. Co Donegal, Laois and Louth saw numbers in their drugs units halved, while Co Clare lost two-thirds of the number of gardaí in its unit. Most other counties saw minor decreases while numbers in counties Kerry, Kildare and Waterford have actually increased since 2011. Numbers in counties Mayo, Meath and Tipperary have stayed the same. The decrease of more than 35pc between 2011 and 2019 comes as the number of controlled drug offences increased by approximately 13pc in the same period nationally, from 17,571 in 2011 to 20,153 between June 2018 and June 2019. Unacceptable John Curran, Fianna Fáil TD for Dublin Mid-West - an area that has seen its number of drug unit gardaí drop from 35 to seven in that period - said that these cuts were "unacceptable". "These cuts are unacceptable, particularly when we see high levels of drug crime continuing," he said. "Extra resources are badly needed in these divisions and not reductions like we have been seeing over the past few years." Responding to Mr Curran, Justice and Equality Minister Charles Flanagan said that he had "no responsibility for these matters". Garda Commissioner Drew Harris - who Mr Flanagan said is responsible for this distribution of gardaí - had assured him that some the recent budget allocation for An Garda Síochána would go into "assigning resources to specialist bureaus such as the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau". "This bureau leads on the strategy for tackling drugs," Mr Flanagan added. Irish Independent
