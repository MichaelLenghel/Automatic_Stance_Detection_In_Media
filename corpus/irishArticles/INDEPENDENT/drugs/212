Over half of all those treated for drugs related illness by the North Eastern Health Board region are from Louth. A recently published report into drug treatment services in the region, which presents trends in attendance patterns from 1998 - 2001, revealed that during 2001 of the 370 people who were treated for drugs related illnesses, 192 or 51.9% were from Louth, by far the highest total of all the counties served by the NEHB. The next highest total was Meath, whose population provided 113 or 30.5% of all those treated. Cavan (9.5%), Monaghan (6.5%), Dublin (1.1%), Kildare (0.3%) and Offaly (0.3%) made up the total. The report also revealed that since 1998 the number of people presenting with drugs related illnesses had steadily increased from 71 in 1998 to 370 in 2001. This increase, however, was attributed to what the report described as ‘an increase in the numbers misusing drugs and the availability of a more accessible service’. The report goes on to reveal that of those presenting themselves with drugs related illness the average gender break up is around 80% to 20% male to female with the average age of patients being 22. The NEHB report also reveals that of those attending for the first time in 2001 28% were under the age of 18, 74% were living with their parents, 7% had left school before the age of 15, 16% were still at school and 39% were in full time employment. Of the total who attended in 2001 approximatley two-thirds of both males and females were aged between 15 and 24 years of age. Eleven patients were aged under 15. In an analysis of the different types of drugs used by those attending for treatment during the period 1998-2001 the report found a worrying increase in the number of clients whose main drugs of mis-use were cannabis and heroin. The report revealed that those listing cannabis as the main drug of misuse had risen from 44% (31 from a total of 71 patients) in 1998 to 57% (210 of 370 patients) in 2001. Those listing heroin and other opiates as the main drugs of misuse fell from 30% (21 of 71 patients) of the total in 1998 to 26% (95 of 370 patients) in 2001. Those listing ecstasy as their main drug of misuse increased from 10% (7 of 71 patients) in 1998 to 13% (47 of 370 patients) in 2001. One particularly worrying increase, from 14% of the total in 1999 to 24% of the total in 2001), is the number of new patients listing heroin and other opiates as their main drugs of misuse. The numbers listing cannabis and ecstasy as their main drug remained relatively static. While the report accepted that most drugs users use more than one drug the complete breakdown of the main drug of mis-use listed by clients attending in 2001 was cannabis - 210, heroin - 84, Ecstasy - 47, Other opiates - 11, Volatile inhalants - 5, amphetamines - 3, Benzodiazepines - 5, cocaine - 2 and others - 3. The report went on to analyse the frequency with which cannabis, heroin and ecstasy was taken and found that 40% of those who listed cannabis as their main drug of misuse consumed it daily as compared to 59.5% for heroin users and 2.1% for ecstasy users. 59.6% of ecstasy users consumed the drug less than once a month. The report also found that average age at which males first abused any drug (other than alcohol) was 15 while the age for females was 16. The report concludes: ‘The conslusions from the data are that more drug misusers each year are attending for treatment services within the Board’s area and that the main drugs of misuse are cannabis and heroin.
