Community drugs workers, gardai and a former addict addressed a drugs awareness meeting in Kilmore parish hall on Monday night. Kilmore is one of the parishes selected for support under the Irish Bishops' Drugs and Alcohol Initiative (IBDAI). The initiave is a pilot project which supports parishes in preventing drug and alcohol problems in their communities. The well-attended meeting was addressed by Tony Connolly, a local garda stationed in Baldwinstown who worked with the garda drugs squad for four years; community drugs workers, Tommy Redmond and Niamh Clancy and a reformed addict, Bob. Tony Connolly stressed the need for a community approach to tackling the drugs issue, saying that everyone in the community had a responsibility to be pro-active if they are aware of illegal drug-taking happening. Tommy Redmond and Niamh Clancy outlined the services that are available to local communities in the fight against drugs. Reformed addict Bob told his harrowing story which fortunately had a happy ending. He said that he realised he had to seek help and has been off drugs for two and a half years. He has also started an initiative in his local area to help other users to kick the habit. Two members of the Garda Drugs Square, Pat O'Brien and Colum Dunne, showed parents some of the drugs now in regular recreational use. Monday night's community meeting was the first step in raising awareness in the Kilmore area about the dangers of drugs.
