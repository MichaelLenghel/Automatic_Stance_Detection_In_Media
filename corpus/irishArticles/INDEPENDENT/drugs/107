Seven out of 10 who take drugs risk death or serious injury, experts warn RESEARCHERS investigating drug abuse have warned that Ireland is in the early years of a cocaine epidemic. The numbers of new drug addicts reporting that cocaine is their drug of choice rocketed between 1998 and 2002, leading to the Health Research Board warning that all the signs point to an epidemic. A shocking seven in 10 drug users are risking death or serious injury by taking lethal cocktails of drugs on a regular basis, a new report from the HRB finds. Although Dublin, Wicklow and Kildare experienced a decrease in the numbers of heroin addicts presenting for drug treatment in a recent four-year period, the report shows that serious drug use trebled in the rest of the country - from 24.8 people per 100,000 treated in 1998 to 69.7 in 2002. The report shows that of 33,350 treatments provided by drug rehabilitation clinics, a quarter of the cases were people presenting for the first time. It is estimated that by 2002, 287 people in every 100,000 had a drug problem compared with 225 in 1998, an increase of 27pc. And the report also notes that the number of children being treated for drug abuse is soaring - between 1998 and 2002, 18pc of all new cases presenting for treatment were under the age of 18, compared with 3pc before 1998. Overall, opiates were cited as the main problem drug, followed by cannabis. The number of new cases reporting cannabis use as a problem rocketed from 379 in 1998 to 925 in 2002. The number of new cases reporting cocaine as their main drug of choice increased consistently during the same period - from 78 in 1999 to 142 in 2002 - indicating the early years of an epidemic, according to researchers. Last April the 
Irish Independent revealed unpublished figures from Gardai and the Revenue Commissioners which showing that cocaine seizures had risen by almost a third in the last year, confirming that it was now the drug of choice for many recreational drug users. And the type of "main problem" drug varies across the country. Opiates - mainly heroin and cannabis - were the main drugs of choice for addicts in Dublin, the Midlands and the North East, while in the south, south-east and west cannabis and ecstasy were the most common. Among the drug users treated, 72pc reported using more than one drug. Dr Jean Long, senior researcher in the Drug Misuse Research Divison of the HRB, said that mixing different substances made coming off drugs much more difficult. "Use of more than one drug is a high-risk behaviour associated with poorer treatment outcomes." And she warned that 50pc of the young people treated had injected heroin and other drugs before they reached 19 years of age. "Injectors have a higher risk of overdosing or acquiring blood-borne diseases like Hepatitis C and HIV." The report also found that: * Teenagers tend to initiate drug use with cannabis and by inhaling solvents. * Use of opiates, ecstasy and amphetamines (speed) tends to commence in the mid- to late-teens. * Men are far more likely than women to be treated for drug addiction. * People treated for opiate and benzodiazepine (valium, xanax) abuse are more likely to be unemployed than those treated for alcohol, cannabis and ecstasy - drugs more associated with social events.
