by Paul Deering County Sligo has one of the highest rates in the country of people being treated for drug abuse according to a new report which looked at trends from 1998 to 2002. The report, which has just been published by the Health Research Board, revealed that Sligo had an average annual incidence of treated problem drug use of 57.9 cases per 100,000 of the population ranking the county eight highest in Ireland. Sligo has the highest rate in the West and North West and it's even higher than the level in Limerick. The report showed that the incidence in Leitrim was 10.1 cases, Mayo was 10.3 with Galway at 12.9. Roscommon was 12.1 while Donegal was 29.1. Limerick's rate was 51.0 while Longford's was 46.4 and Westmeath, 59.0. The report describes trends in treated problem drug use in Ireland and covered 33,391 cases who lived and were treated here between 1998 and 2002. The incidence rates were highest in Carlow, Dublin and Waterford followed by Cork, Louth, Meath, Westmeath, Sligo, Tipperary and Limerick. The prevalence of treated problem drug use among people aged between 15 and 64 and expressed per 100,000 of the population increased by 27% over the four years. The report points out that apart from Sligo, the incidence rates were lowest in western counties with between 10 and 19 cases per 100,000. Overall during the period, 1998-2002, opiates were the most frequently reported main problem drug while cannabis was the second. Of all cases treated, 28% reported problem use of one drug, 32% reported problem use of two drugs, 26% with three drugs and 15% with four or more drugs. Almost 18% of all new cases treated were under 18 years of age. Young teenagers initiated drug use with cannabis and volatile inhalants. The use of opiates, ecstasy and amphetamines was commenced in mid to late teens. The report points out that given the complex nature of the problems associated with drug misuse it was recognised that there was no single treatment modality for problem drug use. A broad range of services covering treatment and rehabilitation is provided throughout the country. Between 1998 and 2002, 50% of treated drug users had commenced illicit use of drugs before they were 15 years of age. Of those who ever injected illicit drugs, 50% did so before they were 19. The main problem drug in the North West was cannabis (64%) followed by ecstasy (27%) and volatile inhalants (4%). "It is clear that cannabis and ecstasy are the drugs that young people seek treatment for in the late teens while the majority of opiate users seek treatment in their early twenties," the report stated. There were differences in the type of drugs used by males and females with a very high proportion of males treated for cocaine and cannabis use. The highest rates of employment were amongst those using drugs commonly associated with social events and the lowest rates of employment were among those who used opiates and benzodiazepines.
