Drugs mule Michaella McCollum has become a beauty therapist in bid to get early parole from her Peruvian jail cell. The Tyrone woman and accomplice Melissa Reid secured the coveted posts working on inmates' hair and nails in a salon in the notorious Ancon 2 jail.

It is thought that the new positions will help their case if they are to apply for parole. According to another former inmate, Belfast woman Lillian Allen, getting a job in jail significantly increases your chances of being considered for parole. The 49-year-old grandmother, who was freed after three years in the South American prison, said that getting a job in the hair salon is considered "one of the top jobs".

She served three years of an eight-year sentence for smuggling cocaine in 2011. Describing how she made jewellery and how McCollum and Glaswegian Reid started working by sewing purses and wallets, she added they showed "little interest" in harder work. "You quickly learn the best way out of that hell is to get parole. And you only get that if you show an appetite to work," the mother-of-three told the Daily Mirror.

 Michaella McCollum and Melissa Reid / The drug mules waited until two salon workers were released from prison before they landed the coveted jobs. Ms Allen continued: "Peru is the most corrupt country I've ever been to. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. I got out as soon as I could. "Michaella and Melissa were well behaved and kept their heads down. I pray the girls will make it back but I can't see it being anytime soon. "There are eight women in a cell with a hole in the ground for the toilet," she said. "The only thing that takes your mind off it is work." She believes early parole is the best that Dungannon woman McCollum and Reid can hope for as their chances of being transferred to a Northern Irish and Scottish prison could be dashed. In a previous interview with the Sunday Life, Allen described how she escaped Peru by bribing airport police and is now living in England. In January this year, McCollum's repatriation to a Northern Ireland jail was given the go-ahead by the head of the prison service in Belfast. All the necessary paperwork was sent to the Peruvian authorities considering the application for transfer, according to a letter sent by the Northern Ireland Prison Service (NIPS). However, the Peruvian ministry of justice has not officially confirmed she can return home to serve the remainder of her sentence. Belfast Telegraph
