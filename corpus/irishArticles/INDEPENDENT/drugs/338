THE drug statistics for Greystones don't give an accurate picture of the situation on the ground but it remains difficult to catch drug dealers with drugs. Superintendent Pat Ward briefed the members of Greystones Joint Policing Committee last week of the crime figures for the area and said in the first quarter of the year there had been one instance of a person caught in the cultivation of drugs, three people detected for the sale or supply of drugs and six people nabbed for the simple possession of drugs. Cllr Tom Fortune wondered if this was an accurate reflection on the drugs trade in the town, saying that he had heard several stories of drug dealing. Superintendent Ward said the gardaí were also aware of various individuals and their reputed involvement in drugs but said the problem lay in getting evidence. 'Detection of the sale or supply of drugs is one of the most difficult crimes to detect. It eats up more than time that any other crime. It's only as a result of surveillance we can get warrants and the whole operation of drugs makes it very difficult to target people at the higher end of the chain. A lot of the time we are getting street dealers and people at the lower end of the scale. A lot of the crime figures in the district have their origins in drugs. 'A lot of cases involving the sale or supply of drugs are as a result of house searches. We have noticed recently there is a trend of people who we wouldn't have been aware of in the past now involved in supplying drugs. They are buying it on the internet or cultivating their own at home. It's not the people we commonly knew before as people supplying drugs. The figures probably aren't showing the reality and there's a lot more drugs out there.' Bray People
