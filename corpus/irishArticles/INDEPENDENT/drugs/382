The house where Mexican drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman last sought refuge was not out of the way or out of the ordinary. It occupies a corner plot on a busy four-lane boulevard in a neighbourhood favoured by local politicians. Guzman's house looks more like a doctor's office than a residence. The two-storey building is set back from the street and completely obscured by the tops of thick trees. A Montessori school is around the corner. The mother of the governor of Sinaloa, Mario Lopez Valdez, has a home nearby with a round-the-clock local police presence. Lopez said on Saturday that he was shocked by the fact Guzman was captured in Los Mochis, a city of some 250,000 people near the shores of the Gulf of California. "I've been here 50 years and in 50 years there was never a rumour, a hint, I never saw a story saying that this person (Guzman) could be found in Mochis or could be living in Mochis," Lopez said.

REUTERS/Edgard Garrido REUTERS / But Guzman's men appeared to have made preparations in case he ever needed the house. More than a year ago, two brothers who had lived there while running a Baptist church in town either sold or rented the property, said a woman who has worked on the street for years, but declined to give her name. Until then it looked much like the other homes in the neighbourhood, with an open carport protected by a metal gate.

REUTERS/Edgard Garrido REUTERS / But a month or two of intensive renovations transformed the house into an architecturally unremarkable but completely enclosed structure. Windows and glass doors hung with mini-blinds were installed and new walls that advanced right to the pavement. On Friday night, following a gun battle, the tiled foyer beyond that glass door was smeared with blood as white-suited forensic technicians worked inside.

Still, for months after the renovations were completed the property appeared uninhabited. It was only after leaving work Thursday evening that the woman said she noticed a large black pickup parked in front of the home. She had never seen the truck before. Around 4am on Friday, marines raided the house, which government officials said had been under surveillance for weeks. Neighbours say an intense shootout ensued, lasting about two hours. They only ventured out later after hearing on the news what had happened. Five gunmen were killed and six arrested.

REUTERS/Daniel Becerril REUTERS / At an intersection, someone had lifted a manhole cover from a storm sewer and found an abandoned assault rifle. Eventually a team of marines arrived, pulled what reporters remained out of the sewer and secured the rifle. Guzman had apparently fled from the home into the sewer and emerged some distance away, where he commandeered a vehicle and continued his escape until authorities eventually caught him. The area's notoriety is already growing. A family stopped and posed for photos outside the Hotel Doux on the outskirts of Los Mochis where marines took Guzman briefly after his capture. PA Media
