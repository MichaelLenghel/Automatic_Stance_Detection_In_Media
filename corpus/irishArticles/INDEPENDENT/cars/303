Renault's new Megane is expected to go on sale here next June.  The fourth generation of the small-family motor will make its world debut at Frankfurt next week. That will be 20 years after the first one made its initial appearance. Since then more than 6.5 million people worldwide have bought one. This newest version takes its styling cues, as far as I can see anyway, from the new Espace and Talisman models. Neither of the latter two is going on the Irish market - as of now. The new Megane is, according to Renault, 25mm lower, has wider front (47mm) and rear (39mm) track while the wheelbase goes up by 28mm. It is reported the car will herald a move upmarket - in line with what Peugeot have been doing with their cars for the past while. Informed reports say that means better quality plastics and layout in the cabin with a large touchscreen becoming the control centre for most of the car's functions. There will also be an eye-catching, range-topping GT version from the get-go. It will have a different front bumper, wider air intakes, rear spoiler, 18ins alloys and 'Renaultsport' badging at the back, on the wings and at the front. There is no indication of pricing or specification levels for Irish buyers as yet - it is early days.
