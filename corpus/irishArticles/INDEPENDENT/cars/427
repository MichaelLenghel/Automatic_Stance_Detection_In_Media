With the Isofix system, you can simply ‘plug in’ a compatible car seat to the mounting points in the car, making the seat easier to install correctly with less chance of incorrect fitting compared to car seats that use adult seat belts that must be correctly routed through the seat’s belt guides.   Child car seats with Isofix are generally now fastened to the vehicle seats through three anchorage points — two bars that stick out of the back of the car seat or base and that can be locked into the car’s Isofix fittings plus a top tether or a support leg, both of which are designed to stop the car seat from tipping forward in the event of an accident.   A top tether connects the restraint to the top of the car’s seat and acts as a stabilising cord — though there is evidence that people often attach top tethers incorrectly, so care should be taken to follow the instructions exactly if your child car seat has this feature.  A support leg is used to brace the seat or base against the car floor and this feature is generally easier to install properly than a top tether. Indeed, some models provide visual indicators that change from red to green to let you know that the support leg has been correctly positioned and the new Maxi-Cosi Pebble Plus works with the 2WayFix base that comes with batteries powering an audible alarm that will sound if the support leg becomes loose.  However, support legs can only be used with cars that have solid floors — i.e. those that do not have under-floor storage — so you will need to check that your car is suitable for these types of fittings.  Isofix child car seats come in three main varieties:  i) Car seats for younger babies that do not themselves have any Isofix connectors but that clip onto a base, generally bought separately, that is secured to the car via Isofix fittings and that remains in place when the child car seat is lifted in and out; ii) Car seats for older babies and toddlers that have integrated Isofix connectors and quite substantial built-in bases that, again, are usually left installed in the car; iii) Car seats for older children with built-in Isofix connectors that attach to the car but an adult seat belt is also used to hold both the child and seat in place. Since 2011, all new cars must provide a certain number of seating positions with Isofix attachment possibilities, and indeed, most of the child car seat models tested in our current batch can be secured to a car via Isofix as an alternative to using the adult seat belts.
