The New Year is traditionally a time when many of us head out to buy a car. Be careful if borrowing for your new set of wheels, however - you could pay almost €11,000 more for your car than you need to if you choose the wrong car finance. There are two main types of car finance: car loans, where you buy a car using a bank loan; and hire purchase, where you pay monthly repayments for the hire of a car and don't own it until the final payment is made. You'll typically be offered hire purchase if you go to a dealer. A bank will usually offer a loan though some, such as AIB and Bank of Ireland, also offer hire purchase. The Sunday Independent examined the car finance offered by the main banks as well as the hire purchase deals offered by a few dealers. We found that you could pay almost three times as much interest if you use a bank loan, rather than hire purchase, to buy your car. (Up to €4,300 more expensive at the bank) Let's say you're borrowing €20,000 over five years to buy a second-hand family car. According to our survey, the most expensive way to borrow this money is through a car loan from Bank of Ireland. BoI charges between 11.5pc and 12.8pc interest on its car loans, with the lower rate only available if you apply for your loan online or over the phone. At the higher 12.8pc rate, a five-year car loan of €20,000 costs €6,770 at Bank of Ireland. KBC Bank is the second most expensive. A five-year personal loan of €20,000 could cost as much as €6,325 with KBC Bank. The bank offers discounted loans if you repay your loan by direct debit from a KBC current account but even then, the cost of the loan adds up to €5,138. A five-year car loan of €20,000 costs €5,402 with Ulster Bank and €5,236 with AIB. Permanent TSB is the cheapest bank to get a car loan from - as long as the car you are buying is no more than two years old. Permo charges 8.8pc interest on car loans if the car was registered in 2013, 2014 or 2015. At that rate, it costs €4,620 to borrow €20,000 over five years. However, if you're buying a car that is between six and seven years old, Permo charges 10.4pc interest - which would cost you €5,437 over five years. Permo's cheapest car loan, however, still works out more expensive than the hire purchase agreements offered by some dealers. The cheapest way to borrow €20,000 for a car is through hire purchase from Renault Finance or Volkswagen Bank, according to our survey. Renault Finance charges 4.9pc interest on its five-year hire purchase agreements as well as fees of €150. So it would cost €2,467 to borrow €20,000 from Renault over five years - compared to up to €6,770 through a bank loan. However, you must pay a deposit equivalent to a fifth of the price of the car to secure Renault's 4.9pc interest rate. As Volkswagen Bank charges 5.9pc interest on hire purchase, it costs €3,055 to borrow €20,000 over five years. You need a deposit of at least a tenth of the price of the car to get the 5.9pc interest rate. BMW Financial Services charges 7.46pc interest and €150 in hire purchase fees. It would therefore cost €3,883 to borrow €20,000 over five years from BMW. Although a deposit equivalent to a fifth of the price of the car is the "norm" when arranging finance through BMW, "it is not essential", according to a spokesman for BMW Financial Services. First Citizen Finance, a finance company set up by former PTSB executives, is the most expensive for HP, according to our survey. First Citizen charges 8.9pc interest on the hire purchase of a new car and 9.9pc interest if buying a second-hand car. At those rates, it would cost either €4,630 or €4,977 to borrow €20,000 over five years. It costs €4,575 to borrow €20,000 over five years through hire purchase from Bank of Ireland - although this is cheaper than the bank's car loan, this hire purchase agreement was the second most expensive in our survey. A five-year hire purchase agreement of €20,000 cost €4,435 with Toyota Finance and €4,352 with AIB. (Up to €10,984 more expensive at the bank) Let's say you're borrowing €50,000 to buy a new car. Again, the most expensive way to borrow that money is through a loan from Bank of Ireland or KBC. A five-year car loan of €50,000 costs either €15,079 or €16,926 with Bank of Ireland, depending on whether you qualify for the bank's "discounted" loan rate or not. Similarly, a five-year personal loan of €50,000 costs either €15,812 or €12,844 with KBC. As a €50,000 loan for a new car costs €11,549 with Permanent TSB over five years, Permo is the cheapest for a bank loan of this size. However, you'll still save a fortune by picking up the right finance from the right dealer. Renault Finance and VW Bank were the cheapest in our survey for car finance of €50,000 (though most new cars from these dealers are below this price range). A five-year hire purchase agreement of €50,000 costs €5,942 with Renault Finance and €7,647 with Volkswagen Bank. Some dealers offer interest-free hire purchase - but you will usually need a sizeable deposit to secure such finance. Renault Finance ,for example, offers interest-free HP on all of its passenger cars. However, to qualify for Renault's zero interest hire purchase, you need a deposit equivalent to between 35pc and 40pc of the price of the car if it is new - and you must also repay the finance within three years. Unlike bank loans, you must usually buy a car that is being sold by a dealer to borrow money from that dealer. Even if a dealer has the cheapest car finance going, you may have no interest in the cars it is selling. You are not tied to any particular models or brands of cars if buying with a car loan. Furthermore, although HP can often work out cheaper than a bank loan, you won't actually own your car until you make the last repayment. The finance company may also have the right to repossess your car if you fall behind on your repayments. Therefore, make sure you understand how hire purchase works before you sign up to it. You may be able to buy a 2014-reg car today for a tenth less than what you would have paid six months ago. However, January isn't always the best time to buy a car - particularly if you have a car to trade in. "It depends on how many cars the dealer has in his yard," says Padraic Deane, editor of the Motorshow Car Buyers' Guide. Having a popular car to trade in usually strengthens your hand when negotiating a deal. However, the more models of your car a dealer has in stock, the less he will be willing to strike a deal. "The number of used cars coming into a dealer's compound takes off in January," says Mr Deane. "A very busy time of the year for car sales may not be the best time to buy a car if trading one in. "The dealer may have worked through his stock of used cars by mid-February - so it may be a better time to wait and buy your car then." Of course, if you don't have a car to trade in and are buying outright in cash, you should be able to strike a good deal - no matter what time of the year it is. Another thing which could work against you is any pent-up demand that has built up for a car which is in short supply - or which has just been launched. In such cases, you will usually get a better price for such a car by waiting for the demand to subside. "If you have been told you have to wait between three and four weeks to get a car, chances are you won't get as good a deal as on one which is available right away," says Mr Deane. "When new models come out, there will be a huge demand. Wait until the pent-up demand eases if you really like the car." To get the best price for a car, pick three car models you like - and then price those models with three different dealers. The lowest price you get is the one you should use as your bargaining chip to get the other dealers down. "Always go back to your nearest dealer and give them the opportunity to give you the best price," says Mr Deane. "It will always be cheaper to return a car for service or repair if the dealer is near you." Sunday Indo Business
