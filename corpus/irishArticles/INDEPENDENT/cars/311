ALFA ROMEO Hot on the heels of their first SUV, the Stelvio, the Italian brand will launch the Stelvio Quadrifoglio, a high-performance SUV powered by the same 2.9-litre V6 petrol engine as the Giulia Quadrifoglio and priced at €118,795. For 2019, the Giulietta line-up has been refreshed with a new Special B-Tech range which adds extras such as 18" dark gloss alloy wheels, red brake calipers, leather interior and 6.5" Uconnect radio with navigation. ASTON MARTIN With its sights firmly on Bentley's Bentayga and the Lamborghini Urus, Aston Martin confirmed that its upcoming luxury SUV will be named the DBX. It is expected to launch at the end of 2019. AUDI Available to order from January, Audi's e-tron is the luxury car maker's first all-electric vehicle and will have a range of more than 400km.

The second generation of Audi's the Q3 will arrive in showrooms later this month in time for 2019 sales. Offered in both petrol and diesel versions with either front-wheel or quattro four-wheel drive, the new prices have yet to be confirmed. The A1 may be the smallest car in Audi's range but it is every inch the premium car. The second generation sports a dynamic new design and is due here next month. BENTLEY For those who want over-the-top luxury while saving the planet, the arrival of an all-electric Bentley four-door coupe could be just what they're after. Details are vague at this stage but it's likely to launch late 2019. A convertible version of the Continental GTC is expected to launch in time for the summer. BMW A new 3-Series is always big news for BMW and much is expected of this executive saloon.

Prices for the new BMW 3-Series start at €43,770 (RRP) for the 318d SE model and is available to order now. First customer deliveries are expected in Ireland in March 2019.

Prices start from €50,420 for the BMW Z4 sDrive 20i Sport. CITROEN After a successful launch of the C3 Aircross, the French brand will add the new C5 Aircross to their range in January. First revealed at the 2017 Shanghai Motor Show, Citroen's new flagship shares a platform with the Peugeot 3008, the Opel Grandland X and the new DS7. The new Berlingo passenger car is also scheduled to arrive in dealerships in February 2019. No information is available on specifications or prices on any of the models. DACIA More than 10,000 Dusters have found homes in Ireland since it launched under the 'Shockingly Affordable' banner over six years ago and a new and improved version was launched in Ireland this year, still with a price tag less than €18,0000. The Sandero and the Logan MCV have also both been updated with new WLTP engines. DS This may have been a quiet year for the French Brand DS, but 2019 will see the arrival of two new cars. The DS7 Crossback - an Audi Q5 and BMW X3 rival - and a new small SUV, DS3 Crossback to rival the Audi Q2 and MINI Countryman, will join the range next year. By 2025, new DS models will only be available as pure electric or hybrid. FIAT Blending practicality, good looks and low running costs, Fiat's popular 500X gets an update for 2019 and is available with a choice of three trim levels - Urban, City Cross and Cross - three petrol engines, including two new more efficient turbo petrol engines and now comes with a host of safety assistance systems as standard across the range. The new Fiat 500X is on sale now priced from €21,795. FORD This month sees the arrival of the Mustang Bullitt. Celebrating the 50th anniversary of the legendary Warner Bros. film starring Steve McQueen, the new Mustang Bullitt features Ford's 5.0-litre V8 engine enhanced to deliver 464 PS and 529 Nm of torque and is priced from €73,000. The Mondeo Hybrid Electric Vehicle Estate will be here in 2019 and the Ford Active, a Focus crossover, arrives in the first quarter of 2019 and is powered by the same engines as the Focus: 1.5-litre diesel and 1.0-litre EcoBoost petrol. A pumped-up version of Ford's pick-up truck the Ranger arrives in early 2019. The Ranger Raptor is powered by a 2.0 TDCi with 213 bhp and the 10-speed gearbox from the Mustang. A Transit Custom PHEV will arrive in Ireland at the same time. Looking further ahead, a number of new Ford electric, hybrid and plug in hybrids will be confirmed in 2019 including an all-new Mustang- inspired fully electric performance car with a promised range of close to 500km, which will arrive in Ireland in 2020. HONDA The big news for the Japanese brand is its entry into the Hybrid SUV market with the all-new CR-V Hybrid. It arrives in Irish showrooms in February and will be priced from €38,000. The CR-V Hybrid is equipped with an efficient 2.0-litre i-VTEC petrol engine, a powerful electric motor and a lithium ion battery pack. Honda is also to launch their first fully electrified vehicle, the Urban EV, at the end of 2019. HYUNDAI The Kona was the outstanding success for Hyundai this year and wooed buyers with a compelling blend of style, value and day-to-day practicality. An all-electric Kona with a range of 482km has just joined the range, priced from €35,995. JAGUAR With the launch of the first all-electric SUV, the I-Pace, Jaguar were the first premium brand to seriously take on Tesla, and electrification is likely to figure high in their plans through 2019 and beyond. A facelifted XE is scheduled for launch in 2019 and is expected to feature hybrid technology. JEEP A new and improved Jeep Compass was launched this year. For 2019 the Jeep Renegade gets a new look, with updates inside and out. The compact SUV offers true off-road capability and a distinct design. It will be the first model in the Jeep line-up to use the new GSE petrol engine in both 1.0-litre 120bhp and 1.3-litre 150bhp DCT variants. The Renegade is the car for all seasons, but if you need a little more off-road stamina the Trailhawk with a 2.0-litre MultiJet 170bhp auto AWD diesel engine is the one to opt for. A new Jeep Wrangler will also be available to order for 191 and comes in both two-door and four-door configurations. KIA Kia start the year with a new ProCeed powered by a 1.4-litre petrol. The new all-electric Kia e-Niro is likely to arrive in time for 192 sales and will be offered with a choice of two batteries: a 64kw with a range of 485km or a 39.2kw version with 312km range. A new Soul EV will also arrive and will make its world premiere in the US next month. LAND-ROVER Land Rover's new Range Rover Evoque arrives in time for 192 registrations. Little detail is known about the new car yet, but we would expect the second generation Evoque to echo the design cues of the Velar when it gets its global reveal this Thursday. Land Rover remains tight-lipped over the future of the Defender and it's likely we won't see a new version in showrooms until 2020, but it may be revealed towards the end of 2019. LEXUS Lexus is hoping for strong sales from its new rival to the Mercedes-Benz E-Class, BMW 5-Series, Audi A6 and Jaguar XF rival the ES 300h. It arrives January priced from €49,450 with CO2 of 106g and €190 road tax. The 2019 RC 300h should add a dash of excitement to the brand when it goes on sale at the beginning of the year. Priced from €56,950, it is designed to look like a baby LC 500. The first Lexus crossover, the UX 200h, arrives in March. Prices start from €39,500 and it will offer an alternative to the BMW X1, Jaguar E-Pace and the Volvo XC40. MAZDA Next year will be a busy one for Mazda, starting with the launch of the 7th Generation Mazda3. It will be revealed at the LA Motor Show and the first cars are expected to land in Ireland from April. Available in both four-door and five-door versions, it will be powered by a 2.0-litre petrol, 1.8-litre diesel and a new Skyactiv-X petrol engine that delivers improved fuel efficiency and significantly reduced CO2 emissions. A face-lifted CX-5 features the new Platinum+ Grade and arrives early in 2019. Mazda will celebrate the MX-5's 30th anniversary with the launch of a limited-edition model with 184ps.  MERCEDES-BENZ Mercedes-Benz will debut the facelifted C-Class models in saloon, coupe, estate and cabriolet variants from January. Also bound for showrooms during the first quarter of the year is the A-Class saloon and an all-new B-Class range. A new CLA, CLA Shooting Brake and GLE with a seven-seat option will land in the first half of the year, along with a facelifted V-Class and the arrival of the recently announced electric-powered EQC. Mercedes's new all-electric crossover will form the basis for a new range of future Mercs. A new GLS arrives in the second half of the year along with a facelifted GLC Coupe and SUV models. The end of 2019 also sees then the arrival of the all-new GLB. Slotting into the Mercedes-Benz range just below the GLC, the GLB is a mid-size SUV whose many features will include a seven-seat option. MINI MINI will finally embrace electrification next year, with the first electric Mini slated to begin production and arrive in Ireland at the end of 2019. Based on the current Mini Hatchback, the new EV is likely to share the BMW i3 powertrain. MITSUBISHI Mitsubishi's new Outlander PHEV has arrived for 191 sales and is now available in three trim lines: Intense, Instyle and S-Edition. Crucially, it is also 20pc cheaper than before, with prices starting at €39,900. A New ASX will arrive in September 2019, but bigger news for Mitsubishi is the overhaul of their L200 pick-up truck. First launched 40 years ago, it now sports a bold new design and promises better overall refinement and more car-like handling when it arrives next autumn. Irish specifications and prices will be announced closer to the launch. NISSAN Nissan will add two new engines to the Qashqai range - 1.3-litre and 1.7-litre petrol - as well as a new 1.0-litre engine on the Micra. A new extended range version of the world's best-selling electric car, the Leaf, with a new 60kw battery arrives in early 2019, while an updated version of the quirky Juke arrives mid-year. OPEL Opel will introduce an all-new Corsa next year, one of three key models arriving in 2019. The popular small hatchback car is likely to be revealed the Frankfurt Motor Show in September and will be available as a five-door only. An electric version will follow in 2020. Helping to keep running costs down, the large SUV Grandland X Opel will add a plug-in hybrid version to the range in time for 192 sales. The next-generation Vivaro will be produced in both commercial and passenger car variants and will launch next summer. PEUGEOT It is shaping up to be a big year for the French brand, beginning with the launch of a new-generation 508. With a radical look, the new model is sharper and sleeker while inside it benefits from Peugeot's i-Cockpit. Available in four trim levels - Access, Active, Allure and GT Line - and saloon and estate version. Due in showrooms in the spring, petrol and diesel models will go on sale first. A plug-in hybrid petrol with a claimed electric-only range of 50km (WLTP) will join the range toward the end of 2019. Prices for the new 508 start from €32,400. Also coming in time for 191 sales is the new Rifter, a practical MPV that features high levels of safety and comfort equipment, new-generation petrol and diesel engines and is available with five or seven seats. A new Partner van will arrive in Ireland in late 2018. RENAULT It's been a busy few years for the French car brand, with almost its entire range refreshed and revised and they show no signs of slowing down. Both the Kadjar and Scenic ranges will have a new 1.3-litre TCe petrol engine option. The diesel versions of the Kadjar will feature the upgraded 1.5-litre dCi 115 engine and the Scenic gains a new 1.7-litre dCi. Pricing will be announced later this month for both, while updated versions of Renault's Koleos SUV will be announced in early 2019. A new generation Renault Clio and Captur will arrive next year. SEAT SEAT will expand its SUV range in February with the arrival of the all new SEAT Tarraco. It will be available as a five- or seven-seat vehicle. Cupra is the new standalone sporting brand of Seat, and its first car is a hot version of the popular family SUV Ateca. It arrives in showrooms in January. Pricing for both new models will be announced in the coming weeks. SKODA Arriving in January, Skoda's largest SUV car, the Kodiaq, has been given the RS treatment and will be available with the brand's most powerful diesel engine ever installed in a production model. A replacement to the Rapid model is also due here in June and will be unveiled next month. The Scala will come in a range of petrol TSI engines ranging from 95hp to 150hp and also a 1.6-litre TDI 115hp version. SSANGYONG A new version of SsangYong's Korando, the brand's Hyundai Tucson and Nissan Quashqai rival, is due in showrooms next year. Details are sparse at this stage, but an all-electric version is likely in 2020. SUBARU No new additions have been confirmed for the Subaru line-up in 2019, so we can expect a quiet year for the Japanese car maker. SUZUKI Suzuki's long-serving small 4x4, the Jimny, is being replaced. Due at the beginning of 2019, it will be powered by a 1.5-litre petrol that produces 101bhp with emissions of 154g/km. Sporting the familiar no-nonsense boxy look it will be offered with a five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic. Prices are not yet confirmed for the new model. TESLA Right-hand-drive Tesla Model 3 production is finally due to begin in 2019, so we can expect the American electric car company to launch their eagerly awaited Model 3 at the end of next year. TOYOTA The Toyota Camry has returned to the company's line-up after a 14-year hiatus and is reinvented as a petrol-electric hybrid that promises best-in-class fuel economy. Arriving in April, it is offered in three grade options, with prices starting at €39,750. Available to order now, the new fifth-generation RAV4 Hybrid sports a bold new look and comes with new 2.5-litre engine. It is also 10mm wider and 30mm longer wheelbase than its predecessor and with an increased luggage space of up to 580 litres. Prices start from €35,900. Replacing the Auris, a new-generation Corolla in saloon, hatchback and estate versions will be in showrooms from January. Prices for the new Corolla hatchback start from €26,370. Mid year sees the arrival of Toyota's hotly anticipated new Supra sports car. VOLKSWAGEN VW's all new small SUV, the T-Cross, will join the range in April. Aimed squarely at small families and younger buyers, it will compete with the likes of the Peugeot 2008, Nissan Juke and Renault Captur. There will be a choice of two petrol engines initially, both 1.0-litre TSI units putting out either 95bhp or 115bhp. There will most likely be one diesel version offered, a 1.6-litre TDI putting out 95bhp in the T-Cross. The car was revealed to the public a few weeks ago and much like the Polo with which it shares a platform, offers good rear legroom and decent boot space. Pricing has yet to be confirmed, but we expect it to come in at a price not too far from an entry-level Golf. VW will facelift its big-selling Passat in time for the 192 plate, and while the changes won't be revolutionary, you can expect useful improvements in the car's digital innovations. A revised version of the GTE will also be available. Elsewhere in the range, a Golf GTI Tcr (Touring Car Racing) will be a niche addition to the Golf range in March. No word on price yet, but expect it to cost around €48,000. Finally with the first spy shots emerging online of the next Volkswagen Golf, we can expect it in 2019 but little more is known at this stage. VOLVO It's an important year for the Swedish brand, with the launch of the all-new S60 that will complete the transformation of their line-up. It will be available in Ireland from April with a T5 petrol powertrain. The T4 petrol, T8 Twin Engine Hybrid and T6 Twin Engine Hybrid will all follow for 192. Pricing will be confirmed closer to the launch date. Volvo will facelift their largest SUV, the XC90, mid-year and Volvo's plug-in hybrid T6 Twin Engine system will be offered on the S60, V60 and V90 in 2019. Sunday Independent
