Car-value expert Gillian Keogh teams up with Motoring Editor Eddie Cunningham to help you make the right choice with your next purchase. Gillian is Editor of a monthly guidebook on the values of used cars produced by the Motor Trade Publishers team. The team supplies a car-valuing service to the motor trade, insurance companies and finance houses. Q I drive a Mercedes E220. I have been driving Mercs since Honda discontinued the Accord. Yearly mileage 30,000km - work related. Retiring and will downsize this year with free travel etc. Considering buying Honda Civic saloon Premium. Reasons: good-looking car, high spec and space in boot for spare wheel. Your advice please. Gillian: I love the Civic. I suggest it whenever I can. Going for the Premium model is a good idea too. Short advice but what else is there to say other than go enjoy? Oh! and I am jealous. Eddie: Ditto. QWe are a couple in our mid-70s. Driving Ford EcoSport D Jan 2017 (38,000km). Three to four lengthy runs a year. Interested in trading up to new. Concerns: safety, economy and comfort. Reservations about an EV. Would appreciate your advice. Gillian: If you have reservations about an EV, don't go there. You don't do much driving going by your current car's mileage, so an EV could save you a lot of money in the long run, although they are costly new compared with other options. There is a new model EcoSport with a 1.0 petrol engine if you simply wanted to come up a few years. A new model costs €23,525 so you wouldn't have to part with too much. It's not my favourite car. For similar money, how about a Hyundai Kona (Executive, €23,495) or Kia Stonic (K3, €23,695). Or a Volkswagen T-Roc, which does cost a bit more. The SEAT Arona is a good choice (Xcellence, €24,585). All models have a 1.0 petrol engine (for these prices), similar levels of comfort and safety. The Kia has the best warranty term of seven years, Hyundai close behind with five years and the SEAT and VW three years. Money not an issue, I would go for the T-Roc. Eddie: Buy anything except the EcoSport. It is the worst car Ford has made in a long time. I can't argue with Gillian on her choices, but I would go for the smaller Volkswagen T-Cross. I think it is nicer than the T-Roc. Q Here's a situation for you. Budget: max €350/month. Annual mileage: 15,000-20,000km. 5-seater SUV, preferably petrol. Present car: 171 Tuscon Comfort, 44,000km (fully serviced, two years warranty left and dent/scratch free). I bought 171 Tucson for €26,900 on a PCP plan and had put a down payment of €5,000: €330/month for three years (5.9pc rate) and GMV balloon payment of €13,000. Now, three years on, it's decision time to either buy it outright or upgrade. A few dealers offered ballpark €19,000 for trade-in. If current car is in good condition and giving good equity of €6,000 (if sold), does it make sense to just put down the balance (we have saved €13,000 already) and buy it outright? Or, does it make more sense to leverage this equity and invest in next higher model - say 201 Tucson Executive (€35,000 - 3.9pc) or 191 Audi A3 petrol (€40,000 at 3.9pc)? My dealer is advising that it's a no-brainer to go for the upgrade but by my calculations, I'll end up paying €55,000 at the end of six years between two cars which is a much more expensive option than to keep current one and sell it three years later. Gillian: Firstly, you are being offered great money for your car as a trade-in. Secondly, a Tucson is a different car to an A3 so you need to figure out what it is you need. If an A3 is roomy enough for you then why go for an SUV? Next, you are correct: in buying the car outright and keeping it for another three years, you will be saving yourself quite a bit of money but you will be driving the same car for another three years. If that doesn't bother you then I would go that route. If you want a change you have to be prepared to pay more. Another Tucson is an excellent choice; as is the A3. Eddie: You are overlooking the loss of value of your current Tucson if you buy it outright. How many thousand fewer will it be worth in three years? And if anything goes wrong? These are the factors you have to consider. In three years when you come to trade-in what will it cost to get you into a new SUV of that size and stature? My instinct is to go PCP again, given how uncertain the medium term is for diesel, but fight for a better percentage rate for Comfort spec; you don't need higher spec, you need lower APR. That's where you'll save money. Q I have a 141 Jaguar XF diesel (106,000km); annual mileage 10,000-12,000km. It is in good condition and due for NCT. I believe trade-in value is €15,000/€16,000. Or is this too optimistic? Should I keep it until it loses more value, or trade in now at its current value? I don't need diesel and would be happy to go electric. Hybrid would be fine too. Budget on top of trade in is €10,000. I wouldn't want something basic. What is my best option? Gillian: I think you would be better to sell it now. Your expected trade-in value is a bit optimistic: if it's Premium Luxury, you might not be too far off with €15,000. If you are looking for another saloon, go petrol or hybrid rather than electric. I would start with the Lexus IS300. You could come up two years from your current 141. An F-Sport or Premium spec would be best. Something a bit different is a BMW 330e plug-in hybrid. You can come up three years into a 2017 model. If you are happy to go petrol, a Mercedes C-Class is a good choice. Definitely go for automatic. Eddie: Sell it now because its value will fall. Your best option is a Mercedes C-Class. I can't see you bothering with a plug-in. Q We're a one-car Galway household; usually only use it at weekends. City driving is limited to the odd pick-up/drop off or supermarket shop. The car spends most of its life sitting in the driveway. We have one child under two and another on the way. Room is going to be an issue with child seats etc. Our current car, a Toyota Corolla saloon, 2003 1.6 petrol, 190,000km, is old but in good shape. Not really keen on a SUV, a petrol estate type car would be the preferred option. What would you recommend? Budget, including trade-in, is €15,000 (perhaps €500 for trade in?). We did 5/6,000km the last 2/3 years. Five-seater needed. Gillian: The first car I think will suit is the Skoda Fabia estate, mainly because of the space it offers internally without being a pain to park. Petrol estates don't usually go well but the Fabia always attracted buyers. For €15,000, you could get a nearly new model. If you could push your budget another €1,000, a one-year-old (191) should be possible. Another option is a new model. Yes new. A 201 Dacia Logan MCV is an estate, a petrol and costs just €14,540. Dacia isn't usually at the top of the list for next cars but they can often be a good fit. Because they start so low new, they lose little year on year after that. Eddie: The Corolla is fairly roomy so if you foresee an issue with child seats in that you'll be going for a truly big car. I think that would be mad given the few km you put up. The best alternative, on that basis, is a Skoda Octavia estate petrol. But I'm wondering if you need a car at all. Take the purchase price and running costs (depreciation) into account and you'd be able to do a deal for rental when and where you want it. Indo Motoring
