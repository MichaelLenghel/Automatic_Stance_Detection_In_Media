By     Court ReporterBANTEER woman, Margaret OCallaghan, Loughlea, Banteer, had her case dismissed by Judge Patrick Moran, at a Circuit Court By Court Reporter BANTEER woman, Margaret O’Callaghan, Loughlea, Banteer, had her case dismissed by Judge Patrick Moran, at a Circuit Court sitting in Kanturk, after she described injuries she suffered as a result of a road traffic accident on March 4, 1997, in Kanturk. Ms O’Callaghan stated that following the accident she had suffered whiplash, pain in her head and bruising, which lasted for approximately two months. However, Judge Moran stated that he believed she drove too quickly out of an entrance, without stopping, and emerged onto the path of the defendant. The defendant in the case was Niall O’Connor, Fairy Hill, Kanturk. Clare Collins BL, acting for the plaintiff Ms O’Callaghan, told the court that her client was exiting from Keating’s Bakery, Kanturk, where she works when the incident occurred. ``There were cars and lorries parked to her right. Her evidence will be she came out onto the road, stopped to see the traffic and was struck on the right hand side by the defendant’s motor vehicle.’’ Plaintiff Margaret O’Callaghan told the court that she has worked in Keating’s Bakery for approximately ten years and when asked if she recalled March 4, 1997, she told the court, ``I was coming out and there were cars on my right hand side. I was stopped. ``The next thing there was a bang on my right hand side. This car came up and I was struck, I just heard the impact of the car on my right.’’ Referring to photographs presented in court, Ms O’Callaghan proceeded to state that there was a lorry parked below where she was situated. When asked by Ms Collins what she did when she came out on the road, Ms O’Callaghan replied, ``I stopped and I viewed to my right and left. Next thing I was struck. ``The side was all bashed in. My vehicle was stationary at the time, when I was struck.’’ When asked if anything happened her vehicle at the time of impact, Ms O’Callaghan replied, ``No, my car was stopped, my head went back.’’ Ms Collins proceeded to ask the plaintiff what injuries she sustained, to which Ms O’Callaghan replied, ``I had whiplash. I had pains in my head and I had bruising.’’ She added that this had lasted for two months, and she stated that she had attended Mallow hospital, where she consulted with a doctor. When asked how she had been some months after the accident, Ms O’Callaghan stated, ``I still had pain in my neck, I got pain on and off and headaches.’’ She proceeded to tell the court that currently she still gets pain in her head and has to take Panadol for them. ``My neck does affect me; on frosty mornings, when I turn I could find my neck painful.’’ Lorraine O’Sullivan BL, acting for defendant Niall O’Connor, asked Ms O’Callaghan if she had been driving onto the main road at the time of the accident, to which she replied yes. ``There was a very heavy onus on you to make sure there was no traffic coming,’’ continued Ms O’Sullivan. She stated that her client, Mr O’Connor, was coming up Percival Street at the time. ``There was a lorry there and I was stopped when I was struck,’’ Ms O’Callaghan stated. Referring again to photographs produced in court, Ms O’Sullivan told the plaintiff, ``The red car is Mr O’Connor’s car and it wasn’t moved after the accident, he will say.’’ ``On impact I was belted back,’’ stated Ms O’Callaghan, to which Ms O’Sullivan replied, ``The evidence will be you weren’t belted back, that you reversed your car into that position. ``You drove right out into the road, into Mr O’Connor’s path of travel. You didn’t stop and that is what caused the accident,’’ she proceeded. ``Mr O’Connor will say he saw you come out but that you were looking to your left, and I must say that is in keeping with your evidence. ``You said you stopped and looked right and looked left, but you didn’t mention looking right again,’’ Ms O’Sullivan said. ``I was stopped when I was struck, I heard my car being struck,’’ stated Ms O’Callaghan. ``You didn’t see Mr O’Connor’s car before impact is that correct?’’ asked Ms O’Sullivan, to which Ms O’Callaghan replied, ``There was a lorry parked below me.’’ ``I never saw him coming up. I edged as far out as the van, the next thing I was struck,’’ she added, and when asked again if she had seen the defendant before impact, Ms O’Callaghan replied, ``I didn’t see his car.’’ ``You drove out, looking to your left, you didn’t see him and you drove into his path of travel. Isn’t that what happened?,’’ continued Ms O’Sullivan. ``I was pushed back,’’ replied Ms O’Callaghan. ``With the belt and the force of the car, I was driven back.’’ Judge Moran then told Ms O’Callaghan that she had been asked by her own counsel what happened when she was hit and he added that she did not tell him at that stage that her head went back. ``You are coming out of your place of employment. What happened to your car when the car hit you? Did it move?,’’ questioned Judge Moran, to which Ms O’Callaghan replied, ``It drove me back.’’ ``That car looks as if it was reversed back,’’ continued Judge Moran, at which point Ms O’Sullivan addressed Ms O’Callaghan, ``I must put it to you that you reversed into that position.’’ When asked if it was possible her recollection was somewhat faulty, Ms O’Callaghan replied, ``no’’, and when asked once more if she maintained that she was pushed back to a certain point, Ms O’Callaghan replied, ``yes’’. ``You drove out into Mr O’Connor’s path,’’ stated Ms O’Sullivan, ``You looked to the left and you drove out and didn’t stop.’’ Ms Collins BL then asked her client if she had heard any horn being blown on the date, to which Ms O’Callaghan replied, ``no’’. Witness Ms Eileen O’Callaghan, who is a twin sister of the plaintiff, answered, ``yes’’ when asked if she was a passenger in the vehicle on the day in question. Speaking of the incident she told the court, ``We went to pull out, we looked right and left. I was in the car and all I heard was the bang.’’ ``Straight away I was fired back,’’ she added. When asked what was her sister’s view on the right hand side, Ms Eileen O’Callaghan stated, ``When she pulled out there were cars. There was a van, there was a lorry on the right hand side.’’ She proceeded to say that the view was obstructed, and added, ``This car came up at speed and hit right into her.’’ ``She had her indicator on and she was just struck,’’ Eileen O’Sullivan said. ``I must put it to you that she wasn’t stopped, she was driving,’’ stated Ms O’Sullivan to which Ms O’Callaghan replied, ``She was stopped for 25 to 30 seconds.’’ When asked if she had seen the defendant’s vehicle prior to the collision, Ms O’Callaghan replied, ``No, there were cars on the right hand side. She had to come out for a view of the road and she was struck. If she was out any further she would have been killed.’’ Referring to the photographs, Ms O’Sullivan then asked if Ms Margaret O’Callaghan had stopped in the middle of the road, to which her sister replied ``no’’. Defendant Niall O’Connor stated of the incident, ``I was driving up Percival Street. Just as I was approaching Cashman’s Bar a car exited from my left, into my path.’’ ``I noticed the driver was looking to the left, before the impact. She was coming out onto the middle of the road and she was moving when I hit her.’’ When asked if there was anything he could have done to avoid a collision, Mr O’Connor replied, ``There were cars on the left and right. I couldn’t go anywhere.’’ Referring once more to the photographs, he pointed out the area of impact and when asked if the other vehicle was reversed, he replied, ``Yes, it was reversed by the person who was driving it.’’ When asked by Ms Collins if the plaintiff’s car was moving, he replied, ``She was moving.’’ When asked if he blew the horn of his car at the time he stated, ``No, it all happened so fast. She was in the process of moving out onto the road, she was barely moving.’’ After hearing the evidence, Judge Moran told the court, ``She said she came out and she stopped and the next thing she was hit. She identified the location of the accident being somewhat on her side of the road.’’ ``I take the view that the plaintiff come out too quickly, without stopping, and she emerged onto the defendant’s path. He was just upon her at the time.’’ Judge Moran then stated that he was dismissing the case.
