The Sunday Independent examined the cost of importing five new cars from the North to the Republic. We used the basic price outlined on the manufacturer's recommended retail price list for cars in the North. These basic prices did not include the 17.5 per cent value added tax (VAT) or appropriate VRT rate applied to cars in the North. If you have to pay 17.5 per cent VAT -- the rate that applies in Northern Ireland -- when buying a new car in the North, you can claim this VAT back when you import the car to the Republic (as long as the car is less than six months old or has under 6,000km on the clock). If importing a car from the North, you do not have to pay the VRT due in Northern Ireland. You must, however, pay 21 per cent VAT on the value of the car if you import it to the Republic, as well as the appropriate VRT rate. Currently, you must usually pay between 22.5 and 30 per cent VRT in the Republic, depending on the size of your car engine, when you import a car from the North. This VRT must be paid even if the car you are importing is second-hand. If you have an electric car or a car which is powered mainly by ethanol, your VRT bill is usually halved. Toyota Landcruiser V8 5-door, 4.5L, diesel Prices in the Republic start from €126,440, including VAT and VRT, with some dealers quoting €128,390. The basic price of the Toyota Landcruiser V8 in the North is €59,631, excluding VAT and VRT. Once it is imported to the Republic, the VAT bill on the car comes to €12,522. As the car has a 4,461cc engine, you pay 30 per cent VRT on the open market selling price of the car (the price you actually buy the car for). VRT of €30,922.50 is therefore paid and the total cost of the imported car comes to €103,075. This means you could save up to €25,315 by importing a Toyota Landcruiser V8 from the North. Jaguar XK Coupe V8 2-door, 4.2L, petrol This car will cost at least €121,870, including VAT and VRT, if you buy it in the Republic. The basic price of the Jaguar XK Coupe V8 in the North is €64,946. However, once VAT of €13,638.66 and VRT of €33,679 for the Republic are included, the total cost of the imported car comes to €112,264. You could therefore save up to €9,606 by importing the car. Renault Clio Ripcurl 3- & 5-door, 1.2L, petrol The best savings can be made by importing the three-door from the North. The three-door starts from €16,400 in the Republic including VRT and VAT, while the five-door model starts from €16,750, according to the recommended retail prices on Renault's web site. The basic price of the three-door model in the North is €9,857. As the car has a 1,149cc engine, 22.5 per cent VRT must be paid in the Republic. Once VAT and VRT are included, the total price of the imported three-door model comes to €15,389. Therefore, savings of €1,010 would be made by importing the three-door Ripcurl. The basic price of the five-door Ripcurl in the North is €10,634. Once VAT and VRT are paid after importing the car to the Republic, the total price of the car comes to €16,602. You could therefore save only €148 by importing the five-door model from Northern Ireland. Toyota Yaris VVT-i 5-door hatchback, 1L It costs from €16,790, including VAT and VRT, to buy this car in the Republic, and some dealers quoted €17,340 last week. The basic price of this car in the North is €9,995. Once VAT and VRT are added for the Republic, the total cost of the imported car comes to €15,542. Therefore, up to €1,798 savings were made by importing the car. Citroen C4 Picasso 5-seat, 1.6L, diesel Some dealers in the Republic quoted a sale price of €30,600 for this car. The basic price of the car in the North was €17,784. Once VAT and VRT are included for importing the car over the border into the Republic, the total price of the car comes to €28,692. Savings of €1,908 could therefore be made by importing the car.
