A HUGE spike in buying is expected as soon as the July 1 deadline arrives. Order books are healthy but insiders say they expect heavy buying in the early days of 152. That's what happened last year. With lots of enquires and accessible credit, it is generally accepted that more people will buy this July than did so 12 months ago. Everywhere you look or listen there are 'unbeatable' offers. The distributors are pushing hard because they know, come early-to-mid-August, sales will shrivel and the holy grail of market share will fade into the autumn mists. For buyers it is a great time, but a dangerous one too. One where they need as much knowledge as possible to buy the right car at the right time. It is crucial you know that 'new' car isn't so new because there really is a much fresher one due any week. Armed with that knowledge, you can, hopefully make a better decision and drive a more beneficial bargain. So here's what's just in, imminent, coming or just a little further away. Alfa

 The BMW X1. / Their Giulia - a BMW 3-series rival is a late 2015 debutant. Represents the start of a fresh era with new engines, styling, platform and technology. Aston Martin Their DB9 replacement is to a get a twin-turbocharged AMG engine and there is the possibility of a new name. Audi One of the most important cars of the year, the A4, is due for November. Here's the engine lineup for you: 2.0TDI 150bhp/190bhp, 3.0TDI 218bhp/272bhp. The entry-level 2.0TDI (122bhp) is due early next year. Petrols include the 1.4TFSI 150bhp and 2.0TFSI 190bhp. No word on pricing yet. It will be shown at Frankfurt in September and should get here the second week in November. An Avant (estate) will follow in January. Their toned-down new Q7 luxury seven-seater SUV arrives next month with 3.0TDI 272bhp quattro Tiptronic and 3.0TFSI 333bhp quattro Tiptronic models starting off. But the 3.0TDI 218bhp is likely to be most popular and arrives in September. Prices from €72,975 on-the-road (PCP from €759/month); three trim levels - SE, SE Business and S Line. The hot, hot new RS3 Sportback (that's the only body shape) is due in August (2.5TFSI 367bhp S tronic quattro; 0-100kmh in 4.3 seconds). Road tax is €750 (189g/km). Expect it to start around €63,000. Just the one spec level (19ins alloys, Nappa leather sports seats, LED headlights, Parking System Plus etc).

 The BMW X1. / Then there is the new R8 Coupe quattro in October; pick the 5.2-litre FSI V10 (540bhp) or the 5.2FSI V10+ with 610bhp (0-100kmh 3.2 seconds; top speed 330kmh). Pricing yet to be announced. There will be a Spyder version next year. Bentley Their Grand Convertible is due late this year. The Azure comes back as, effectively, a convertible version of the Mulsanne (what a car to luxuriate in). And we can expect the marque's first SUV the Bentayga late this year/early next. Also next year there will be the extreme performance rear-drive sports car - for around €400,000. BMW The second generation X1 arrives in October. Prices start from €41,310 OTR (sDrive 18d SE). The 3-Series is revised and gets here later in the year. Also the new 7-series (from €96,880 for the 730d) arrives late October. Citroen A revised DS5 is due in July, as is a new Berlingo. The DS5 will be the first model unveiled by the new stand-alone brand while the Berlingo is claimed to have much lower running costs. Dacia They have special 'Prime' editions of the Duster family crossover, Sandero supermini and Logan estate. Ferrari The 488 GTB - replacement for the 458 Italia - is imminent and has a turbocharged V8. Fiat They have a 5dr saloon lined up for early 2016. Hope it makes it here. And early 2016 we'll get to see their new roadster, based on the Mazda MX-5 platform. The little 500 gets a 2016 facelift. Ford They have a plethora of models on the way: the revised C-MAX, new Galaxy, S-MAX and Mustang. There will also be an all-wheel-drive and hybrid Mondeo in September/October. And the upmarket Mondeo Vignale saloon is due late next month or early August; the 2-litre TDCi 180PS manual will start from around €44,000. The C-MAX will come in Zetec and Titanium trim with three engines: 1.0 EcoBoost (100PS, 125PS, both 117g/km), a 1.5 TDCi (95PS, 120PS, both 105g/km) and a 2.0 TDCi 150PS (114g/km). The S-MAX is likely in September (again in two trims: Zetec and Titanium). Engines will include the 2.0 litre TDCi 120PS, 150PS (AWD option) and 180PS; and 160PS 1.5 litre EcoBoost petrol. Prices will start from €33,860. It looks like the Galaxy will get here in August but details of line-up and price have yet to be finalised. And the Mustang is a November arrival. It will have a 2.3-litre EcoBoost and 5-litre V8 and prices start from €46,000 for the former and €62,000 for the latter. The 5-litre V8 pumps 420bhp; the 2.3-litre EcoBoost, which will be the big seller, manages 314bhp. Sensational drive; not perfect on the road but you love it all the more as a result. Look forward to the Focus RS too. And the larger SUV, the Edge, is an early 2016 arrival; there will be the Ka city car, the refreshed EcoSport and new GT supercar. Honda The first CR-V automatics are just arriving - they have the new 9spd auto box in the 1.6 i-DTEC 160 AWD - starting from €39,995. We're getting a lot of queries about automatics from readers. The smaller new HR-V crossover arrives in late summer with first models most likely in August. Again it will be late summer for the new Jazz. Lovely car. They begin production of the exceptional Civic Type R in July but are taking special orders from now. Expect a mid-to-late €40,000s start price. And the NSX supercar is likely at the end of the year - it pumps 550bhp from its hybrid powertrain (V6 engine and three electric motors). Hyundai They have just brought in the newly-revised i30 and i40 models, the latter going exceptionally well in the large family/fleet sector. Expect the facelifted ix20 later in the year and the Tucson replacement for the big-selling ix35 in the autumn after Frankfurt debuts. The Santa Fe gets a refresh towards the end of the year. Jaguar The new XE rival for the BMW 3-series has just arrived. There is big interest in this. A lot hangs on it for Jaguar Land Rover after mega-investment. Expect the new (I still think the current one looks great) mid-size XF saloon in late October. It will have a 2-litre diesel (163bhp, 180bhp), a 3-litre (300bhp), and a 380bhp V6 petrol. There will be Prestige, R-Sport and Portfolio trim levels for the 2-litre diesel. I'm told prices will be 'competitive' with the BMW 5-series (mid-€40,000s). And there will be a facelifted XJ saloon this autumn. The much-anticipated F-PACE crossover - a first Jaguar SUV - is expected next April. Jeep The Grand Cherokee is due a facelift late this year. KIA The major news will be the new Sportage for January but there is little detail as of now, except it will make its European debut at Frankfurt. They will have an improved and revised cee'd by the last quarter of 2015 with a GT Line being introduced. Powering it will be the current 1.6-litre diesel or an all-new 1-litre turbo petrol. You can order it with a new 7spd DCT transmission too. Around the same time, we'll see the new Optima (first seen at the New York Show in April). The European version will be shown in Frankfurt in September. Lamborghini The Huracan Spyder is imminent, we are told, while the wonderful Aventador SV (740bhp V12) is eagerly anticipated. The Urus is some way off, however (2018), and is expected to share underpinnings with Bentley's Bentayga. Land Rover The onset of their own new diesel engines means most models will benefit over the coming months and years. The Range Rover Evoque gets the 2-litre diesel in September. And the Discovery Sport gets it around that time too. Watch out for the Range Rover Evoque convertible in the first quarter of next year. The Range Rover SVAutobiography is a summer debutant. It's the most expensive and luxurious Range Rover in history. Lexus Their new RX450h will roll out in December but they have no prices or spec yet. Also looking forward to the RC sports coupe in January. This, as you know, is like the excellent RC-F but has a 2.5-litre petrol/hybrid and that means, I'm told, it will "be priced to compete directly with Audi A5". Maserati The Levante, the marque's new luxury SUV, is likely before the end of the year. Mazda One of the busiest marques around, they are claiming to have five new cars for July. Some are not new, to be fair, but are refreshed. In the case of the '6', imperceptibly so I have to say. Anyway, there is the 'revised' 6, the revised CX-5 crossover, the new 2 is already here, the smart compact crossover CX-3 and '3'. The new MX-5 roadster (from €27,995) is due in early autumn with a 1.5-litre 131PS petrol engine. Mercedes-Benz The 'top people's' carmaker and Audi are pushing out new models at a phenomenal rate. Here's just a quick rundown of what's in the pipeline for Mercedes. This month we get the S-Class Maybach, GLE Coupe, C-Class C160 petrol manual, the S-Class S350 BlueTEC 9G Tronic and S500 9G Tronic. That's just one month. In August there will be the GLC 4Matic and the sensational AMG GT. In September we can expect to see the face-lifted A-Class, the 4Matic version of the GLE, and B-Class B160 petrol. Then in October there will be the new C-Class Coupé, the 250 petrol in the GLA as well as the CLA Shooting Brake (180 CDi). That's enough to be going on with for now. Mini A bigger, roomier Clubman estate is planned shortly - and this one will have four proper doors. A new Countryman is pencilled in for next year - it will be bigger. Mitsubishi The new L200 pick-up is an autumn arrival while there are reports of an Outlander facelift for next year following sighting of an upgrade at the New York Motor Show. Nissan Their next new vehicle will be the Navara and it is likely to be a September/October arrival. No further information on engines, spec or pricing. Opel Their new 5dr city-car KARL (from €11,995) arrives in August with a 1-litre petrol (75bhp) manual - an automatic is due early 2016. The marque's OnStar in-car technology is due for widespread unveiling in September. Lets you hook up with lots of stuff - from roadside assistance to vehicle diagnostics. During 2016 they say they will have a fully integrated wi-fi hotspot for up to seven devices. The new Astra arrives in October. Shorter, lower and lighter, its price won't be far off the current one which starts at €20,195 for the 1.4-litre petrol and €22,495 for the 1.6-litre diesel. A Frankfurt motor show debutant, it has a large touchscreen infotainment system, multi-function steering wheel and Corsa-like instrument cluster display. There will be a 5dr hatchback, 3dr coupe and estate and as many as 13 engines. Peugeot The heavily-revised 208 is expected next month. Engines include 1-litre and 1.2-litre petrols, as well as the ultra-frugal 1.6 BlueHDi (75bhp, 100bhp). The new Partner Tepee MPV is also likely to be a July arrival with 1.6-litre diesels (75bhp, 92bhp), manual and automatic (from September) transmissions. The next generation Partner van (two different lengths) is scheduled for July too and again the 1.6-litre diesel supplies the power: 75bhp/92bhp. Watch out for the 3008 CDV - you've guessed it - this arrives in July. And the 1.6 115bhp engine is under the bonnet. The new 308GTi is one to look forward to as well. Porsche The 911 is facelifted later this year after its expected debut at Frankfurt as is the Cayman in the final quarter of 2015, with a new GT4 version a highlight. The Boxster will be revised before the end of the year. Lots of changes in line for the Panamera well into next year. Renault Its first mid-size crossover, the KADJAR, is due in September. Larger than the big-selling Captur and drawing on the Nissan Qashqai, it will come as a 4x2 and 4x4. There will be three diesels, one petrol and four trim levels. The mix of SUV/estate/saloon will include a 1.2-litre turbocharged TCe 130bhp 4cyl direct-injection petrol, a 1.5-litre dCi 110bhp 4cyl diesel (manual and automatic) and a 1.6-litre dCi 4cyl 130bhp diesel. They have also added top-of-the-range trim level to the Captur called the Signature which starts from €22,190. Included are the R-Link infotainment system with 7ins touchscreen, sat nav, USB connectivity and an uprated 4 x 35W Arkamys radio with 3D sound, rear parking camera, sensors and Grip Xtend traction control system. Next year we'll see the Alpine rear-drive, two-seat coupe. Rolls-Royce The Dawn convertible is due this autumn and the marque is planning an SUV for 2017. SEAT The revised version of the evergreen Alhambra arrives in September. Engines include a 2.0 TDI (115bhp, 150bhp) with S and SE spec levels. Its starting price will be €38,595 (for the S) and €46,395 (for the SE DSG). The core changes include front grille, rear LED tail lamps, new-generation media system plus etc. And a revised Ibiza arrives in September. The engines include a 1-litre petrol 75bhp, 110bhp DSG, 1.4-litre diesel 75bhp and 90bhp, 1.2 TSI 90bhp and 110bhp petrol. No word on pricing yet. Skoda The new Superb goes on sale next month. Prices start at €27,795 for the 1.6-litre TDI. It's longer and wider with huge space in the cabin and boot. And it drives better. The new Octavia RS 230 arrives next month too with a 2.0 TSI 230PS petrol and a starting price of €35,995. They are saying it costs just €620 more than the 220PS petrol yet includes XDS+ Differential, RS Challenge Pack and has a leather interior. The Monte Carlo version of the Fabia goes on sale next month with 1.0 75PS, 1.2 90PS, 1.2 110PS petrols and 1.4 TDI 90PS, 105PS diesels. It has 16ins Italia alloys, Monte Carlo trim, Panoramic glass roof, rear parking sensor, special sports seats and cabin. Prices start at €17,995. SsangYong Their big arrival is the compact crossover Tivoli which starts from €19,995 for the 1.6-litre petrol (€390 road tax) and €21,495 for the 1.6-litre diesel (€190 tax). The latter, which is the one to go for, arrives in August; the petrol in July. Two spec levels and there's an automatic as well as manual 6spd gearbox. Standard equipment includes air con, cruise control, alloys, fog lamps, smart steering and Bluetooth. The Rexton gets a facelift next month. With a 2-litre 155bhp diesel, prices start from €34,495. The Rodius also gets a revision in July (I was going to say facelift but that would be stretching it with this car's controversial looks). The 2-litre diesel (155bhp) prices start from €39,995 (6spd manual/auto). The Korando Sport also gets a facelift from July and its 2-litre diesel 155bhp version starts from €29,995 (also 6spd manual or auto). Suzuki They will have a new family car (called the iK2 for now) with a 1.4-litre petrol in time for the 161-reg (there, I said it) - say November. And a small crossover-type called the iM4 by March with 2WD and 4WD. Toyota They've just started with the new Avensis here and are making much play of the fact that the Toyota Safety Sense package is standard. They've put new 1.6-litre and 2-litre diesels under the bonnet (both BMW engines) and claim up to €900 savings in running costs over three years/90,000km. The heavily-revised/new Auris family hatch is another to hit the showrooms this summer. It has a 1.2 turbo petrol engine which should be interesting. And there's an Aygo Xwave on sale now - it has a canvas roof - and costs from €15,995. The new Prius is a fourth-quarter arrival but there isn't much by way of detail, spec or pricing. It will be shown at Frankfurt. Volkswagen Their new people-carrier Touran is a much improved looking product. The seven-seater gets here in late autumn; it's 13cm longer with the wheelbase up 11cm. It also has a new folding-seat set-up. Improved engines include a 1.6-litre 110bhp, a 2-litre (150bhp and 190bhp) as well as 1.2-litre TSI turbo and 1.4-litre petrols. Prices will start around €29,000 (petrol) and €31,200 (diesel). Then there will be the Passat Alltrak with 4MOTION permanent all-wheel drive and 2,200kg towing capacity. It sits 27.5mm higher than the conventional car and has 2.0 TDI 150PS/190PS options. Spec will be Highline 'with a little more'. Should start around the €45,000 mark. The Golf GTE plug-in hybrid arrives next month. It has a 1.4-litre TSI 150PS petrol engine and a 102PS electric motor and will cost €38,495. It will be sold by five or six dealers. The new Passat will get the option of 4MOTION for €3,300 extra. And there is a new Passat 240bhp BiTurbo DSG in Highline spec for around €47,000. Volvo The big focus is the newly-arrived large XC90 SUV. The D5 diesel AWD (1969cc, 4cyl, 225bhp, 8spd box, €390 road tax) costs from €70,950. The T8 AWD, petrol, 1,969cc, 407bhp plus 80bhp from electric, 49g/km €170 road tax is on its way. Exceptional. Engine line-up will be expanded towards the end of the year to include a D4 190bhp FWD version. New rugged V60 Cross Country here just in time for the 152-registration period too. It has their new Drive-E engine. Also here is the V60 Twin Engine diesel hybrid V60 (48g/km). Interesting car. Other models get new more powerful engines. The large/luxury S80/V90 saloon and estate are due early next summer. There will be a facelift for the V40/V40 Cross Country then as well. Irish Independent
