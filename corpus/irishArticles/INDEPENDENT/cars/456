MOTOR DEALERS in County Wexford are hopeful that the market has turned a corner and better times are ahead in 2014 and with healthy pre-orders the industry could be on the up after years in the doldrums. While nationally car sales were down by more than 5,000 units last year, despite the introduction of the six-month registration system, the Model County held on to its figures, albeit with a very modest increase of nine more cars sold in 2013 than in the previous year. Figures for the county provided by the SIMI show 1,821 passenger cars were sold in Wexford in 2013, representing 2.45 per cent of the national share. The final new vehicle statistics for 2013 issued by SIMI (Society of the Irish Motor Industry) show that the sale of new cars was down 104 units (-33%) in December compared to 2012 (down from 316 to 212). For the full year 2013, new car sales were down seven per cent (5,271) on 2012 (74,303 V 79,574). New Light Commercial sales (vans) were up three per cent on 2012 (11,076 V 10,804) and Heavy Commercial Vehicle sales (trucks) were up 27 per cent (1,717 V 1,354) on 2012. Kevin O'Reilly, the general manager of O'Leary Volkswagen, in Wexford, said that despite the decline in 2013, there was a lot more confidence in the market now and he expected a significant improvement in sales during 2014. 'Pre-sales are up 30 per cent and we are very optimistic about 2014, with national sales of above 80,000,' said Mr. O'Leary. SIMI's Director General said that while the new car market is down on last year, it did stage a strong recovery in the 132 registration period (July-December) after a very poor first six months. 'The Commercial Vehicle sales figures are also an indication of recovery in the sector and the latest jobs figures from the CSO show 1,000 more people working in the Motor Industry now compared to the middle of 2013,' he said. Mr. Nolan said dealers around the country have been reporting an increase in showroom traffic and stronger sales activity for the new 141 registration period in January compared to last year. The busiest month for dealers in 2013 was in July, when the new mid-year second registration period started, with 1,669 cars being sold. In December only 212 cars were sold. Volkswagen was the biggest seller with 9,508 units, representing 12.8 per cent of the market, followed by Toyota with a 10.32 per cent share at 7,665 units and Ford with 10.26 per cent and 7,621 units. Skoda took a 6.6 per cent share of the market with 4,903 units in 2013. Top selling models in 2013 were the Volkswagen Golf, the Nissan Qashqai and the Ford Focus. Audi again took top honours in the premium brands with 3,700 sales representing five per cent of the market. Small standard cars dominated the market in 2013, with 22,302 units being sold. Interestingly 'Jeeps' and SUVs accounted for a third of the sales with 11,833 sales, almost 2,000 more than compared to 9,989 medium-sized cars of which 9,989 were sold. Sales of diesel cars stood at 72.52 per cent of the market during 2013 with 53,887 units, dwarfing the petrol-engined share which achieved 19,786 sales, 26.63 per cent of the market. With the differential between petrol and diesel prices at the pumps now hovering at around five cents and some petrol models matching or exceeding diesels in terms of consumption, the trend towards buying diesels may slow this year. Despite the ESB's rollouts of fast charge points for electric cars and government subsidies for anyone buying one, they have so far failed to achieve any significant share of the market. In fact electric car sales nationally fell to 0.06 per cent of the market at 46 units in 2013, compared to 138 units with a 0.17 per cent share a year earlier. Thomas MacDonald, sales manager at Nissan dealer Wexford Car Centre, said 2013 had been tough but he was looking forward to a better 2014. 'I'm very optimistic about this year. We have an entirely new model line-up and our pre-sale orders are substantially up.' Mr. McDonald said that with more fast charge points coming in stream in the county, there was more activity in electric cars with 'slow but steady interest' this year. 'We sold Nissan Leaf models for January and have maybe three or four on the edge.' He said the Leaf, including the outright purchase of a battery that would cost you £75 a month in the UK, was priced as low as €21,690, and competed with conventional models such as the Nissan Juke and Ford Focus. Mr. McDonald said another change in the market was the re-emergence of a competative market in car finance with companies calling weekly if not daily for business. And there had been big growth in the PCP market in which car buyers only pay for the a new car over the time that they use it. Not surprisingly cars in the 'A' tax band with CO2 emissions of between 0-120 accounted for most sales nationally and locally in 2013 at 45,391 units acccounting for almost 62 per cent. In 2012, Band 'A' vehicles accounted for 53.69 per cent of the market with 42,725 units. Band 'B' cars with CO2 emissions of 121-140 took a 32.73 per cent share with 24,323 units and Band 'C' with CO2 emissions of 141-155 took a four per cent share with 3,008 sales in 2013. In 2012, Band 'B' sales stood at 38.25 per cent, with 30,437 sales, and Band 'C' accounted for 4.42 cent share with 3,438 sales. Cars with higher emissions accounted for 2.3 per cent of overall sales in 2013, compared to almosty four per cent the previous year. The most popular colour was silver, followed by black, grey, maroon, blue and white. Gold was the least popular colour. Wexford People
