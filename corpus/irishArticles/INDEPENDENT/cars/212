The Society of the Irish Motor Industry predicts another exceptional year for new car sales based on January 2001 performance. January 2001 statistics released earlier this week show new passenger car sales of 33,848, an increase of 25.07% on the same period in 1999. This comparison is more realistic than a comparison with January 2000. ‘Year 2000 was a record year for new car sales, which reached 230,840 sales, a 32.47% increase in 1999. The appeal of the ‘00 registration plate and the introduction of car testing (which resulted in more older cars being decommissioned and replaced by new cars) contributed to the unprecedented January 2000 performance,’ said Cyril McHugh, Chief Executive of the Society of the Irish Motor Industry. Toyotas, Nissans, Fords and Volkswagens were the most popular brands registered in January 2001. 3,870 toyotas were sold in the first month of the year while 3,567 volkswagens were purchased in the same month. 3,796 nissans were purchased while 3,735 fords were registered. Fiats were the next most popular brand of car for buyers. 2,295 fiat cars were sold in the month of January. So how do local Fingal dealerships perceive the sales in the first month of 2001? The Fingal Independent spoke to a few car dealers in the area and got their varying opinions on the market early in the new year. John Newman of John Newman Motors in Ashbourne said that compared with sales in January 2000, sales this year are ‘holding their own’. He sells a lot of Japanese imports and the market for second-hand cars is still on the rise. He said that ‘the trend seems to be to avoid bangers. People are very conscious of the NCT (National Car Test),’ he said. ‘They have a bee in their bonnet’. Mr Newman went on to say that cars registered in 1997 and later are very popular. Volkswagens and the Japanese imports seem to be attractive to buyers, he said. David Lee of Des Darcy Motors in Swords told the Fingal Independent that sales of their Honda range were high in January, 2001. ‘We’re expecting a very good year,’ he said. It appears from industry figures that 2001 will only be second behind 2000 in terms of car sales, he said. The market in second-hand cars, especially ‘00, ‘99 and ‘98 registered cars was very good in January, he said. The new four-door Honda Civic was very popular in the month of January. Des Darcy Motors have already received a lot of inquiries for the new five door Honda Civic that will be launched in March. Alex McAllister of McAllister’s Garage in Malahide said that the car sales in January 2001 were much the same as the sales in January 2000. McAllister’s deal in Audis and Volkswagens. In contrast to Des Darcy Motors, Mr McAllister said that the market in second-hand cars seems to be down this year. Ciaran Ferguson of Eric Leonard Motors told the Fingal Independent that sales are very strong and that all their Renault models are selling well. He said that sales in January, 2000 were ‘abnormal in terms of volume sold,’ and that the sales in February 2001 will probably mirror the sales in February 2000. Eric Leonard Motors, Lusk, have been trading in the area for 25 years. Sales in second-hand cars are probably the same as last year, said Ciaran Ferguson. Second-hand cars in very good condition and low mileage tend to attract buyers, he added. Dave Byrne of Crosson Opelcentre on North Street in Swords said that sales this January were down 15% compared with the same period in the Millennium Year. He said that sales in second-hand cars were ‘improving’ and that the arrival of new Opel Corsa has sparked a lot of interest. The new Opel Corsa has been voted the Irish Car of the Year in 2001 by motoring correspondents according to Mr Byrne. He added that the Opel is Europe’s safest car in its class and that GM are ‘rightly proud’ of it. Jack Kelly of Kelly Motors in Lusk told the Fingal Independent that sales of second-hand cars in January 2001 were better than in January 2000. Kelly Motors deal in 3,4,5 and 6 year-old cars and Jack Kelly found that consumers last year were looking for 2000 registered cars rather than older cars.
