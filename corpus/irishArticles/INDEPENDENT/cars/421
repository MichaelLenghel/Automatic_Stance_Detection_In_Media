Aidan Timmons and Motoring Editor Eddie Cunningham team up to help readers make the right choice with their next car. Aidan visits dealers all over the country to produce a monthly guidebook on the values of used cars. He is co-editor of Motor Trade Publishers, who supply a car-valuing service to the motor trade, insurance companies and finance houses. Eddie is author of former bestselling book 'Clever Car Buying' I drive a Hyundai ix35. For five years in a row I changed my car every year usually for €4,500/€5,000. However, in 2016 the Hyundai Tucson was introduced to the market and garages upped the change price to €6,500 as it was a new model. I put up 40,000km yearly so in 2018 my mileage should be 120,000km when I'm tempted to trade up to a new one again. My question is: As cars lose most value in the first 2 years would €15,000 be a fair price with my own to move up to a 181? Or would I be better keeping my money and driving my car to the ground. My worry is if I keep it and try to change it when it's 6 years old there will be 240,000km on it and no one will take it from me. Aidan: If I understand this correctly, you are still driving a 2015-plate ix35 with an odometer that will soon reach 120,000km. You had considered changing to the Tucson in 2016 but the cost to change was too steep. I think you should change now for two reasons. The first is Hyundai's five-year warranty. If you change after six years, it's a high-mileage machine with no warranty. At least now warranty for the car is still on Hyundai's books. Second, you have already exited the cycle of changing your car every year and the longer you leave it, the greater the potential for not getting back into a new car again. Have you already negotiated on €15,000 to change to a new Tucson or is that the amount you are comfortable paying? If the latter, you need to test your thinking with a dealer. There is probably a good chance of doing a competitive deal on a 172-plate if you're happy to change now. Something to mull over. Eddie: Think about it this way. If you 'run it into the ground' what will it cost to get you back to where you are now? And what about repairs etc as it gets older? I sympathise with what looks like a steep step but you are putting up big mileage. Try to do a deal now for a January Tucson; 120,000km these days is not a deal-buster; 160,000km in 2019 puts a different complexion on things.
