DUHALLOW might well be in the midst of the darkest recession to grip the land but there could, in fact, be a building boom in the offing as, according to the detailed draft County Development Plan, over 3,000 houses will need to be built over the next decade. The number might well be viewed as mind boggling considering that Duhallow has in excess of 1,852 people who are unemployed. Mixed into the economic turmoil is the uncertainty facing every person concerning the upcoming hairshirt budget, and not forgetting the IMF who are still in town doing very nervous number crunching for the nation. However, according to the draft development plan the major towns in the Kanturk Electoral Division will see a housing explosion over the next decade, with Charleville leading the way. At present, there are 1,693 houses in Charleville, but it had a growth of 943 units over the past decade, and up to this year outline planning permission for 675 further units has been granted. Over the next 10 years the county council expects the town will need 1,250 more dwellings. Kanturk also saw a boom in the last decade with 815 houses being built. At present there are 1,207 houses but, according to the draft local area plan, there is outline planning permission for an additional 119 units and the regions' target growth for the next decade will see another 600 houses needed. Millstreet has 685 dwellings and over the last decade 248 houses were building. But the expected growth over the next 10 years is for another 270 houses. In nearby Newmarket there are 485 houses and during the boom years 248 houses were built. According to the plan, the expected growth over the next 10 years is for an additional 270 houses. While the Celtic Tiger did not roar in Duhallow, as industry is slim on the ground, this did not deter the building frenzy which took hold. The council's draft plan reveals how housing has mushroomed in villages dotted throughout the area; though many houses remain empty or unfinished. In Ballydesmond there are 109 houses but over the last 10 years 34 of these have been built, and there is outline planning permission for 53 more units. In Boherbue there are 223 houses, 46 built in the past ten years with planning for 37 further units. The plan anticipates a total of 150 more units up to 2020. However, there are already a number of empty houses in these villages, particularly in Boherbue. It raises the question of who who will be living in a region which already has a deluge of empty and unfinished houses. By the end of the Celtic Tiger, Dromina had 111 houses, and there is an expected growth of 30 more units over the next decade, and outline planning already for 77. The village with the largest proportionate influx of building was Castlemagner, which presently has 113 dwellings. According to the plan, there were just 12 houses in the village prior to the boom. A staggering 101 houses were built over the last decade. However, the plan expects 30 more houses will be needed by 2020, with 26 applications already granted. In contrast, in Kiskeam there is an expected growth of just one house over the next 10 years. At present, there are 42 houses but outlined planning has been sought for 24 units naturally outside the village. In Rockchapel village there are presently 42 houses, but in the last decade 14 other houses have been build, and for 2010 the council has received outline planning permission for 10 more houses.
