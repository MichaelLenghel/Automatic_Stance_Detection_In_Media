It's both a quirky country house and a trainspotter's dream. The former Saintfield Railway Station has been lovingly transformed into the perfect family home for those with £750,000 (€1.03m) to spare.

 / Spread over three buildings, the house has its own platform, waiting area and signal room - and even its own subway to take you to the other side of the tracks. The station, part of the old Belfast and County Down Railway, was originally constructed in 1856 and operated for almost 100 years before closing its doors in 1950. The current owners took over in 1997 and began a labour of love to restore the site, which includes the old Station Master's house. The old open-air platform, once busy with the hustle and bustle of railway life, is transformed with floor to ceiling windows stretching more than 27 metres in length, and what was once the ticket office is now the entrance hall and includes the original ticket hatch. Overlooking it all is the signal cabin, the last one standing belonging to the old railway line, with the magnificent track levers still in place.

 / The track itself may now be grass, but you are never far away from railway reminders, with original noticeboards and signs such as 'General Waiting Room' and 'Ladies Waiting Room' fixed to the doors and the Station Master's bell still proudly displayed. Those looking closely enough at the platform will also see where it was forcibly lowered by US soldiers stationed nearby during World War Two, who needed to transport weapons and other ammunition into the station. Estate agent Jonathan Quinn, from Quinn Property Sales and Letting Specialists in Ballynahinch, Co Down, said the value of the Station Road property may well exceed the £750,000 (€1.03m) guide price as they have simply no idea how valuable the original railway memorabilia may be. "The house has been up less than a week and there has been a huge amount of interest in it already," he said. "We were hoping it would appeal to railway enthusiasts. Most likely it will appeal to somebody looking to come out to the country and live somewhere a bit different. It is a once in a lifetime opportunity. "From our own perspective it is an honour and a privilege to be able to sell a property like this. It is completely different to anything we have been asked to sell before. "When you see what is on offer, the history, it's amazing." Belfast Telegraph
