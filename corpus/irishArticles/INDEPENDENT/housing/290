WEXFORD has been allocated almost ?40 million for social housing in 2008 to help tackle the lengthy local authority housing lists and growing demand for affordable housing. Wexford County Council is to receive a total of just over ?23 million for the entire county, including Gorey town. That will include ?20.5 million for local authority housing; ?1.1 million for voluntary and co-operative housing; ?700,000 for Traveller's accommodation and ?750,000 for putting central heating in council houses. Wexford Borough Council is to get ?6.3 million. Local authority housing will account for ?5 million of that, while central heating will account for ?1.3 million. Enniscorthy Town Council has been allocated ?5.5 million for local authority housing. New Ross Town Council is getting ?4.5 million for its housing programme and ?200,000 for its central heating programme. Fianna Fáil's Seán Connick said the ?39,550,000 in funding for social housing will greatly help the local authorities within the county to increase their supply of social and affordable housing'. Social housing, once characterised by sprawling housing estates on the edge of towns has now been replaced by projects which seek to deliver a sustainable social mix within local communities. This grant will go a long way towards allowing us to deliver this form of social housing within the county,' said Deputy Connick. Minister for Housing Batt O'Keeffe last week also released details of the Quarter 4, Housing Statistics Bulletin, part of a quarterly series which track progress by local authorities in the delivery of social and affordable housing. Last year the Government delivered 9,469 social and 3,567 affordable housing units. The Minister also referred to the important role of the voluntary and co-operative sector in responding to housing need, which delivered an unprecedented 2,200 new housing starts in 2007. There were 3,194 home completions in County Wexford in 2007, according to the latest Quarterly Housing Statistics. The figures are based on the number of meters installed by the ESB. Of those completions, Wexford County Council and the respective town councils were responsible for 272, meaning that 2,922 were private houses.
