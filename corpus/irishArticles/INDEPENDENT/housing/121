A bungalow which offers dramatic views of West Cork’s coastline might be the ideal family home for those interested in living on what might feel like the edge of the world. The property, which was built in 1960, is located in Tralispean and boasts expansive seaside views of the Atlantic Ocean, which is most definitely its most attractive quality. The three-bedroom house has been upgraded throughout the years, most recently by an Irish couple based in the UK who used the home to retreat from the busyness of London life. Since it was first built, the home has been extended offering more space and The bungalow is pitched on six acres of land and because of this offers potential home-owners bountiful privacy but at the same time is located just five miles from Skibbereen. Within the modern extension are the homes three bedrooms, a bathroom and a utility room. The living room is also housed in this part of the home and opens up onto the sea through two sets of sliding glass doors.
