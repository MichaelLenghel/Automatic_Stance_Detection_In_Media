Some of the biggest names in Hollywood have made their way up the red carpet for tonight's Baftas. Best actor rivals Eddie Redmayne and Michael Keaton were amongst the first to meet fans and pose for pictures at the event. Other famous names arriving at the ceremony, held at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, central London, included Boyhood star Patricia Arquette. Paying tribute to the film's director, Richard Linklater, she said there was "no other" like him. The event, formally known as the EE British Academy Film Awards, is hosted by Stephen Fry. Redmayne has already won a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild Award for his role playing scientist Stephen Hawking in The Theory Of Everything.

Matt Crossick/PA Wire  PA / The actor said playing the physicist, who has continued with his groundbreaking work despite a serious illness which left him wheelchair-bound, was "terrifying". He said: "It gave me many a sleepless night." Another star admitting to nerves was Gone Girl's Rosamund Pike, nominated for the leading actress award, who said she was so worried about the film she called Tom Cruise the night before filming started for advice. She said: "He told me 'You're going to crush this. You're with a director who isn't going to allow you to fail'."

REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett REUTERS / Among The Theory Of Everything's other nominations are best British film, best adapted screenplay and best director for James Marsh. Mike Leigh's Mr Turner is nominated for four awards including costume design and make-up and hair but there was no recognition for Timothy Spall's performance in the title role which won him the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Leigh himself is guaranteed at least one award - it has already been announced he is being honoured with a Bafta Fellowship. Former England football captain David Beckham, who is presenting an award tonight, refused to be drawn on what his favourite film of the year was but admitted Paddington was a big hit with his family.

Other stars joining the ex-Manchester United star on the red carpet were Keira Knightley and Benedict Cumberbatch.
