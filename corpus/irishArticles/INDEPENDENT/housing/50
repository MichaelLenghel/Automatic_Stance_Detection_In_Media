In the 1700s and 1800s, Ireland's Big Houses and country estates were built with kitchen gardens to keep the residents self-sufficient. While many were subsequently abandoned and left unloved, a new-found focus on sustainability and a thriving country house hotel scene has seen many of these fine properties rediscovering the joys and benefits of their historic walled gardens. Most have undergone extensive restoration work, creating beautiful spaces for guests to visit, while providing an abundance of organic, in-season crops to the kitchen. It's a lovely way for country houses and hotels to showcase the best of homegrown produce - and nothing beats a stroll in a burgeoning walled garden before tucking into a menu of seasonal vegetables, salads, fruit and herbs with zero food miles and that irresistible just-picked flavour.
