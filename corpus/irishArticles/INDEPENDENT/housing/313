A four bedroom house which has been extensively redesigned by its owner who is an interior decorator is now on the market for €950,000. The stunning Victorian property on Terenure Road West was purchased in 1995 and the interior marries the classic features on the original home with a sleek modernity. The home’s kitchen, living and dining room are largely open plan and flooded with light making up an extension that was erected during a remodel in 2006. The maple kitchen units are fitted with top class mod cons and the room allows access to the garden through means of glass doors and also a home office. Overlooking the idyllic kitchen is a mezzanine which curves around the bright and airy space. The home boasts four bedrooms, each of which can be found on the first floor of the property. The master bedroom is en suite and offers a walk in wardrobe to its dwellers.
