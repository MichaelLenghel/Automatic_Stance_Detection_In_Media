US Couple Grant and Sarah travelled to Ireland to have their incredibly intimate and alternative wedding on the rugged shores of West Cork - part of Ireland's Wild Atlantic Way - and the photos by Irish wedding photographer Shane O'Sullivan of SOSAC Photography were nothing short of spectacular. Chicago-natives Grant Goedde (27) and Sarah Ryan (26) met in University, but despite the two spending four years of classes together, Grant only got around to asking his future wife out in the final few days of study! Grant popped the question on the couple's first week of their relocation to London, where he presented Sarah with a photo album featuring his favourite moments from their four years together.

 / The couple opted for an intimate wedding with a humanist ceremony under a dramatic tree on the grounds of the exclusive Dunowen House, former Cork residence of Jimi Hendrix Experience basest Noel Redding. The bride wore a soft tulle gown by online wedding boutique BHLDN with beautiful floral appliqué detailing, while the groom opted for a chic black suit from Cad & the Dandy, which he accessorised with a grey-blue tie.

 / Their hand-tying ceremony, led by Humanist celebrant Bill Chase, meant guests could be involved in their celebrations, with each taking turns to wrap the bride and groom's clasped hands in their choice of ribbon, rope and anything else that took their fancy! "We had a humanist ceremony," said the bride. "The wedding was outdoors under a large tree on the property. The readings and structure of the ceremony were selected by us and delivered beautifully with harp music in the background. We did a hand fasting ceremony where we encouraged our families to bring any item they chose to tie our hands together. It was funny to see the creativity that inspired. It also lightened the mood."

 / A relaxed reception on the terrace focused on a fabulous vegan spread prepared by Kela at Dunowen House, where the produce is grown in the surrounding gardens. "We searched all over Ireland to find a house big enough to hold our families for the week," said bride Sarah. "We also wanted a relaxed setting. Dunowen was a perfect fit. Kela provided an amazing vegan middle eastern themed meal. Many of the ingredients were fresh from her garden."

 / The small wedding perfectly fitted the couple's non-traditional style. The day went by smoothly without stress, allowing the couple to soak in the surroundings and enjoy being in the company of friends and family. "We wanted a small and intimate wedding. The thought of planning a large traditional wedding did not appeal to us. We kept things simple which made planning enjoyable." Guests ate and played frisbee and other games before the happy couple headed off for a short photo shoot at Sandscove with photographer Shane of SOSAC Photography.

 / The success of their own intimate wedding was down to keeping things simple, they say, and they advised other couples wanting to enjoy some no-stress wedding planning to do the same. "Relax and enjoy the planning. Keep it simple. Try to make every piece you care about meaningful and don't stress over the parts that are not important to you."
