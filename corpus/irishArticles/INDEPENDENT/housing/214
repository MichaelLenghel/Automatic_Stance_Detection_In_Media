Taoiseach Bertie Ahern's house in Drumcondra jumped in price by almost £10,000 in the two weeks before it was sold to Michael Wall in December 1994, according to documents from the Mahon Tribunal seen by the Sunday Independent. The huge jump of about €13,000 shows Mr Ahern's future home was among those caught in the maelstrom of the early days of the property boom when values went up almost overnight. A number of other houses on the market in the area at the time were among those properties examined by Celia Larkin and Mr Wall during a frenetic period in the market. Mr Ahern's house, number 44 Beresford Avenue, has been the subject of much examination and speculation since the controversy over his personal finances began last year. According to estate agent documents, the house was worth £124,000 on July 8, 1994. Another list provided shows that on November 18, just two weeks before Michael Wall bought the house after a meeting with Mr Ahern, the house was valued at £129,500. Another list, dated only two days before the house was sold showed it was valued at £138,000. Mr Wall bought the house and Mr Ahern claims he rented it up until the time he purchased it outright in 1997. Mr Ahern has always denied that Mr Wall bought the house on his behalf and still insists that he was unaware that Mr Wall left the house to him in his will. Included in the tribunal documents, are a list of other potential houses that were on the market in the area at the time. The fascinating lists give an indication as to where Mr Ahern may have ended up had the Beresford property not worked out. The lists show that number 44 Beresford Avenue was, by far, the most expensive property on offer in the area at the time. The next most expensive house was 66 St Canice's Road, Glasnevin, which was valued at £75,000. There were five properties all around the £70,000 mark. These houses included number 13 Marlborough Road, Dublin 7. A smart large semi detached house with a red-bricked front, a popular design feature in the area. Another house was 32 St Peter's Road, Phibsboro, which was valued at £72,000. A smart red-bricked mid-terraced house, which is no more than a stone's throw away from St Luke's, Mr Ahern's base of operations. It appeared that Mr Ahern was willing to look as far as Cabra for a suitable house. On the list, valued at £72,000, was another terraced red-bricked house. Number 12 Cabra Park was similar to the house on St Peter's Road but today it appears not to be in as good condition. It is interesting to note that several of the properties on the list are of a much older style compared to the modern style of number 44 Beresford. Two other large modern semi-detached houses on the tribunal list were 636 Collins Avenue Extension (valued at £65,000) and 41 Hazlewood Park, Artane (valued at £71,500). Confusion surrounding the house at Beresford was not helped by Mr Ahern's declaration to a biographer that he paid £139,000 for the house, only £1,000 more than the sum Mr Wall paid for it three years previously. Then, in the midst of the controversy last October, Mr Ahern stated in the Dail that he paid £180,000 for the house. When cornered out on the hustings trail days before polling, Mr Ahern admitted to the Sunday Independent, that the lower figure he gave to a biographer about how much he spent on his house was wrong. Until his admission, Mr Ahern had refused to explain the discrepancy in the two figures. When pressed by the Sunday Independent, he admitted the figure was in fact wrong. Mr Ahern said: "The house was £180,000. £150,000 came from an Irish Permanent building society -- £139,000, I gave that figure. As you, know that book is one I didn't stand over, in terms of the figures. "You asked me the question, how much did my house cost me, I said £139,000. But the legal documents state, that the house cost £180,000."
