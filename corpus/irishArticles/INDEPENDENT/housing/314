This will be another turbulent year in the Irish property market as supply impacts on values in some areas, but not in others; as lending restrictions increase impact through the regions; and as renovations costs surge and Brexit continues to dampen some markets. To clarify where the property industry believes we are headed in 2020, we put the big questions to a panel of five experts who, between them, represent most of Ireland's property professionals.

 Anthony McGhee / With more than 20 years experience in the property business, Anthony is chairman of the Real Estate Alliance (REA), a nationwide network of more than 50 long-established estate agencies and he heads up the REA McGee estate agency based in Tallaght.  It is likely that property prices will rise by between 2-3pc in 2020. The Central Bank fiscal rules, which are somewhat overbearing, and an increase in the availability of new homes in the capital, are leading to a period of price stabilisation. It is likely that entry-level prices will rise at the greatest rate as buyers are more concerned about finding a home to live in or let out. I anticipate that house prices at the top end of the market will remain fairly level for the most part of 2020 but may improve towards the latter part of the year as one would hope that there should be some clarity on Brexit. The REA thinks prices will rise by 2.4pc nationally in 2020, with Brexit closure bringing at least some clarity to an average house-price market that has seen prices falling by -0.6pc nationally and -4.3pc in Dublin. Our Dublin agents are forecasting a 3pc rise, believing that Brexit certainty will stimulate activity in a market that has seen -4.34pc price drops, fewer buyers and increasing selling times over the past year with much of the potential for price rebounds coming in the mid to upper end of the market, which experienced the sharpest falls in 2019. We expect prices to remain largely stable over the course of 2020. Price inflation will be underpinned by the starter-home market while price inflation in the mid- to upper-end of the market will be lower as the tight lending environment limits liquidity. I am expecting the market to be flat but selling. We are likely to see a little shift in sales and prices now that Brexit looks like it is finally being settled.  However, I don't see a return to a buyers' market. Instead of the market correcting as it sees fit, it seems to move from crisis to crisis. This year will see rent inflation slowing to 3pc in Dublin but hitting around 6-7pc in commuter belt counties with Cork, Galway and Limerick cities probably falling somewhere between the two. Rents are set to rise for the foreseeable future as demand continues to outstrip supply. Rent caps and increasingly complex rent regulations are forcing smaller landlords out of the market. For every two landlords that are selling their investment property, only one is purchasing. The construction of more student accommodation and new apartment complexes may impact the supply issue in the medium term. Rents are likely to rise by between 2-4pc in 2020 in the capital. Certain properties may see no inflation as affordability starts to kick in at the middle to upper level but as the majority of property is let at under market value due to rent control measures, most will rise by 4pc this year.  However, rents in high-population regional urban centres are set to surpass 5pc this year, with home-building outside the capital at a critically low level. Increased supply of new buy-to-let properties and student accommodation will lead to a welcome reduction in the level of rent rises over the next few years.  We expect rent inflation in the order of 5-7pc. The demand for rental accommodation will continue to expand. When combined with the continued exodus of investors from the rental market, it means there is every reason to believe that supply levels will continue to disappoint, and rents will increase further. Tight supply will increase rents further.  It is doubtful whether the Rent Pressure Zones are working because we are seeing rents climbing far in excess of 4pc per annum. The biggest factor has been Brexit and the uncertainty it has caused. The second is the availability of finance and the difficulty of average-wage earners being able to borrow enough money to buy a property, despite the fact they can demonstrate they are capable of paying rents well in excess of mortgage repayments and that their mortgage would be financially sustainable. Third is the high cost of new homes, with no official building index to chart and inform all interests of the true costs of building and where those costs lie. The lack of available finance for first-time buyers, the lack of supply - especially in the more affordable €200k-€300k range - and uncertainty caused by Brexit are the factors most cited by our members. On a macro level, the failure to tackle the high cost of development land and rising construction costs are putting the viability of new-home building under extreme pressure. First is the ongoing shortage of supply of the type of affordable accommodation that is most in demand (€200,000 to €300,000). Second comes the high cost of delivery. You cannot deliver product unless it is profitable. The tax take from residential property is too high and is impacting on viability, with roughly a third of the price paid for a new home going to the State. When combined with the high cost of land, building and labour, development is still not viable in many instances. Finally, there is now a big mismatch between mortgage payments and rental costs. We have a catch-22 situation between spiralling rents and sizeable deposits.  Banks should be able to take into account that someone who has been paying €2,000 a month for the past 10 years in rent should qualify for a mortgage. They have already proven their ability to pay. Instead, they end up trapped in rental. It seems that progress on stabilising the accommodation crisis has been very limited. Notably construction output is disappointing, the exodus of investors from the market has persisted and rents are continuing to rise. That said, the continuation of the Help-To-Buy scheme was positive. Whilst it is very easy to criticise Government policy, I personally believe its performance has been reasonably good in the last 12 months. The decision to extend the Help-to-Buy scheme was an important measure to support the new-homes market.  The Government seems to be making inroads in terms of providing social housing but, as we all know, more is needed. Whilst units are being provided the short-term, outlook is still bleak in terms of more people becoming homeless. The Government continues to favour large-scale investors who are principally REITs and large international funds. Tenants will soon realise that long-term renting is not a sensible nor viable solution as once they reach retirement age many will discover the state pension is not sufficient to cover even the most modest rented home in the capital. This is a crisis in the making.  I would like to see an affordable-housing scheme available for all new homes, whether they are built on state lands or not, as is available in the UK. Home ownership should not just be for the privileged. Poor. No cohesive property plan is in place between the Government and the private sector to provide new homes. We need to help developers to build - the tax take from residential property is too high and is impacting on viability. Rebuilding Ireland contains good elements, however the drip-feed nature of announcements has not been good for the market. The retention of Help to Buy, however, is to be welcomed. Yes, new homes are too expensive. IPAV has been calling for an official monthly building index for years. Currently there are vastly different prices for similar, comparable properties throughout the country. There is a huge divergence between the prices builders want and what people can afford to pay and what they can borrow under the Central Bank mortgage lending rules.  The ESRI recently said we need to drive down prices and build more houses, but builders won't build more housing until they can sell what they have built already and buyers can't get enough money to buy existing stock - this is one reason why available stock is not selling. New homes are costly to build, and this obviously influences the sale price. Our studies show that if land cost can be reduced, this would help lower the price of new homes. We believe the best approach is to reduce Capital Gains Tax for a defined period. If you look at traditional housing, at the moment, land cost can make up to 20pc of the cost of a new three-bed semi.  Once you factor in common areas, etc, you are looking at between 15 to 20 homes per acre. That means a land cost of €50 to €60k per house. If we are serious about addressing the cost of constructing new homes, we need to look at the cost of land. We propose reducing CGT for zoned serviced residential land from 33pc to 8pc for a defined period.  I don't believe new homes are too expensive. However, the difficulty of saving a deposit (especially while paying rent) and complying with lending rules means buying is not realistic for many. We should follow the UK with a shared equity loan scheme. The Government stake is up to 40pc in London and 20pc elsewhere. The first-time buyer puts up 5pc deposit and takes out a 75pc or 55pc mortgage for the balance. When sold, the Government gets its stake back with a percentage of the upside. Property priced at the upper end of the market, particularly in excess of €2.5m, has been the most challenging to sell. This end of the market is more influenced by international sentiment, and Brexit uncertainty has remained a significant concern this year. A new UK government and a clear direction for Brexit will lead to increased confidence at this end of the market. Indeed, a hard Brexit could materially assist this end of the market as many high-end buyers could end up moving to Ireland in that scenario. Properties priced over €500,000 are proving most difficult to sell. To some degree, this could be related to Brexit as we have noticed a decrease in enquiries from Britain in the last six months in particular. Where people are trading up it is taking increasingly longer to agree a sale on their own property. The second-hand market is slowing, in the €500k-plus range in Dublin and in the €400k-plus bracket elsewhere. Lending rules discriminate against second-time buyers, who have to find a higher 20pc deposit if they want to move to a bigger property. As a result, many people who bought five or 10 years ago are unable to move on through no fault of their own - quite the opposite, in fact. They have become 'house blockers'! While we agree that the Central Bank lending rules have been effective in preventing buyers from taking on unmanageable debt, we think they should be open to adaptation as the recovery continues and 10pc for all would be a move in the right direction. Outside of Dublin, properties over €300,000 are hardest to sell. In Dublin properties, it's homes in the price range of €450,000 to €650,000. For €250k, a two- or three-bed house in Limerick city: strong capital appreciation and good rental income. For €350k, a 2/3-bed house in Galway or Cork cities, for the same reasons. €600k: an apartment in the CBD in Dublin: stable investment. (a) €250,000: I would buy in Tallaght, where there is a good supply of homes with superb facilities such as The Square, Luas, hospital and TU Campus all within easy access to the motorway network. Three-beds are achieving €2,100 per month. (b) €350,000: Kilmainham/ Inchicore with St James's Hospital and Heuston Station nearby and within walking distance of city centre. Two-bed apartments are renting for €2,000pm.  (c) €600,000: Castleknock, for capital growth. A wonderful village with a host of facilities. Three-bed houses typically let for €2,400 a month. €250,000: a 2-3 bed apartment beside one of the Luas stops in Tallaght or Citywest. Rent of €24,000 pa with a 10pc yield. Tenants are abundant, with Tallaght Hospital, Tallaght RTC and The Square, with a large workforce in the many industrial estates on its doorstep. €350,000: a two-bed apartment in the Dublin Docklands. At the centre of a high-employment area for highest-paid employees. €600,000: I would favour a Pre-'63 investment property (house in multiple residential units) on the Northside of the city near one of the new Luas stops; 8pc-9pc yields can still be obtained, which are now a rarity for this asset class on the Southside of the city. Specifically, I would buy between Phibsborough and in or around the North Circular Road. Phibsborough will become one of the most sought-after areas in the future and the price divide between some areas of the north and south sides of the city will narrow as the cross-city Luas effect takes hold. I totally disagree with the term 'cuckoo funds'. This completely misrepresents the role that the Private Rental Sector (PRS) plays in the market. The emergence of the PRS is a very positive factor for the market and should stimulate supply. However, it is not the panacea and much more needs to be done to stabilise the rental market.    The presence of international funds and REITs (real estate investment trusts), and their purchase of apartment buildings, is in the most part welcome. Many of these schemes would not be constructed without such buyers due to the limited available finance. Their involvement is adding to the country's housing stock. However, the accommodation they provide tends to be at the upper end and unaffordable for many. It also means these apartments are not available to individual buyers, some of whom would wish to trade down from larger homes, if the choice was available to them. It's true that international investors are buying up a significant proportion of new properties in the PRS and Build to Let sector, and reducing options for first-time buyers, but the flip side is that if these weren't investing in the market, a lot fewer new apartments would be built. While they are attracting some negative publicity, the situation highlights the lack of Government-led supply initiatives and this is where we need to focus our energies.  Funds were needed to get the market up and running in 2013-15 but are now beginning to dominate the market. A builder can sell an apartment complex or estate to a fund because it pays a premium price for the lot. Up to July, they've been able raise rents to justify this buying price, despite being within RPZs. Being a first-time buyer always brings its own challenges, with every generation feeling they have it harder than the previous! Unfortunately, right now is a particularly difficult time to be a first- time buyer due to the lack of supply and the high cost of rent making it even harder to save for a deposit. This generation has been caught in a 'housing catch 22'. The Taoiseach said the success or failure of this government would come down to how it dealt with the housing issue. The electorate will soon get the opportunity to give their verdict on that and other issues. Sadly it depends on how much you earn. If you're earning €80k to €100k, it's a good time, as you will have a choice of properties. But if you're in the lower earnings bracket of €40-50k, you may well be able to afford a mortgage but be unable to get one large enough to buy a property, unless you have financial support from family. It is a difficult time for many first-time buyers who spend so much on spiralling rent and childcare that it is almost impossible to save a 10pc deposit. This leads to extended rental periods, affecting supply and further pushing up rental prices in a cost-of-living spiral. A combination of low interest rates and rising rents means that it is much more attractive to buy rather than rent in the current market. As such, it is arguably a very good time to be a first-time buyer. Yes. Renting a home is not a good long-term solution and more expensive than buying. FTBs of new homes can avail of the Help to Buy scheme while competing lenders are offering incentives like cash-back offers to win them over. We will probably have a new government shortly so one would hope that solving the housing crisis will be its number-one priority. First of all, they should reduce CGT on serviced land. The Minister for Housing should establish a cross-departmental emergency housing council to ensure we build the 34,000 houses we need per annum. Our population is set to grow by two million over the next 30 years: that's an increase of 42pc. The Land Development Agency will have a critical role to play in providing those homes, but we need to see much more progress from it. A proactive campaign to get unused and underutilised stock back into the market. Finally, some weight behind the need to retrofit our existing homes in order to assist in tackling the climate emergency. Social housing and homelessness remain a key concern. I urge government to take a three-pronged approach. First the State needs to continue to acquire properties to deal with the current national emergency as it is the quickest and easiest way to provide a short-term, albeit part solution. Second, it should identify a number of large key sites and build on them in the short term, and finally it needs to accelerate a number of public-private partnerships on State-owned land through local authorities and the new Land Development Agency.  Keep facilitating an increase in new-home supply. We need 35,000 new homes every year. Relying on the private sector alone to increase supply is clearly a bad strategy. We need to develop public housing in tandem with the private sector. We need different types for social housing, current homeowners, first-time buyers and investors. We need to be aware of what is being developed as Build to Rent. This ever-increasing trend reduces choice on the market and also sets a higher bar for rents in an area. Irish Independent
