The former home of tennis champion Joshua Pim in Dublin’s Killiney has been placed on the market for €2.3m. The five-bedroom abode sits on Killiney’s Hill Road and offers spectacular views of the ocean in one of Dublin’s most expensive neighbourhoods. The 2,583sq ft. house sits on almost an acre of grounds and within it, a tennis court once used by the athlete who won two Wimbledon titles in the late 1800s.  Entering the property’s bright red door, one is welcomed into an entrance hall, with high ceilings and colourful yellow walls, which leads onto a large dining room and reception room on either side. The property also houses a patio, which offers inhabitants a space in which to retreat.  On the second level, five bedrooms can be found and a large main bathroom. A corridor leads onto a sixth bedroom, which once housed the property’s servants.
