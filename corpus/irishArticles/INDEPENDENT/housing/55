Last year, there were 96 lettings by Dundalk Town Council, 50 new houses and 46 re-lets. “In the current year, there are a total of 68 re-lets coming through, 40 of these are let and 20 have yet to be allocated,” added Jim Byrne. In the Voluntary Housing Association in the last few years, there were 48 lettings by the Response initiative (’01) none in 2002, and so far in 2003 there have been 83 new houses from the Cluid Voluntary Housing Association, in Farndreg and Clontigora. “The North& East Housing Scheme is also nearing completion, which should be available next January. The 67 Clanmil Houses will be available sometime in 2005, and the Council’s Turnkey development will be starting shortly which amounts to 88 house.” He added that the Dublin Road scheme had 110 houses, work on which is set to start next year, and will be due for completion the following year. The Newry Road Scheme, which is still in the public consultation phase is also set to begin construction in mid 2005 or 2006. “The Council are also looking at a 53 house turnkey development scheme for the Blackrock Road, but there has been no public consultation on this yet,” said Mr. Byrne. 12 Affordable houses have been sold at Farndreg, 16 houses on Bellewsbridge Road (eight of which will be sold as affordable housing). The Council’s Housing Support Unit also attended the meeting to give an outline of the level od damage to Council houses, once tenants move from the premises. Members were told that the level of damage is assessed on a 1-5 category system, 1 being very little repairs needed, and 5 being extensive damage to the house. Of the 68 houses being re-let to date in 2003: 6- were in category 1, 16 - in category 2, 19- in category 3, 11- in category 4 and 16- in category 5. Tenants often left behind large amounts of their own belongings including furniture, rubbish, beds, and blackbags filled with household waste, all of which had to be removed. Councillors were informed that the most severely damaged houses can take six weeks or more to repair and prepare for new tenants. With the level of repairs being done to re-lets, the Council are currently giving out one house per week. Seven houses are being worked on at present, three or four of which should be ready in the coming weeks. On some occasions there are ‘high risk’ houses which have to boarded up and re-boarded because they are a target for vandals and trespassers. Colr Kevin Meenan asked how such housing repairs and maintenance are impinging on the Council’s budget. Town Clerk, Frank Pentony revealed that ?520,000 was allocated for this purpose in the Council’s last budget, and in 2003 so far a total of ?426,000 has been spent. “If we continue at this rate there is no doubt that we will exceed the Housing budget by a long shot,” said Mr. Pentony. He added that 40 re-lets had been completed so far, the cost of which was “eating through” the Council’s budget. Councillor Jim Cousins raised the issue of inspection procedures being carried out when tenants are living in Council houses instead of the current system of “merely reacting” to damage being caused. “Yes, if we had ample staff this would be a good idea. If there was staff whose work was solely to carry out inspections, of course it could be done. The biggest problem the Council faces is tenants leaving huge amounts of rubbish and furniture etc behind” was the reply. The Housing Support Unit told Councillors that it was “more so a case of a lack of respect for the property.” Around 40% of damage to houses could be regarded as normal or expected wear and tear. The remaining 60% was deliberate and showed a lack of respect. Colr. Pearse O’Hanrahan asked if former tenants could be tracked down and asked to cover the cost of the damage, to which Jim Byrne responded “No, but deposits can be withheld.” Colr. Martin Bellew asked if tenants are re-compensed for any improvements they make to the property such as new radiators, doors, or central heating. The Town Clerk revealed that they are currently looking at a policy which may permit such compensation, but only if the additions are of acceptable Fire and Health and safety standards, and are in good condition. Colr Seamus Keelan pointed out that monies from the Estates Management fund should be 100% used, and if not needed could be out towards house maintenance costs. It was also revealed that around 70%-90% of the monies paid out for remedial works to council houses is mainly to cover the cost of wages for trades people and other services.
