The huge value chasm that has opened between city and country homes since the crash means it is now possible to buy a period country mansion for the price of a two-bed apartment in Dublin. Dublin city homes have shot up in value since the recovery began due to tight supply, but those properties located in more isolated rural locations which have remained unaffected by improving economic conditions, have been much slower to regain price. It means that eight bedroom mansions on their own grounds can now be acquired for the same price - or in some cases, less than half of the price - of a tiny home now deemed 'affordable' in the capital under the new state loan scheme. Under the Rebuilding Ireland Loan, which kicked off earlier this month, state mortgages are being made available through local authorities to those who cannot get on the property ladder with an upper price 'affordable home' limit of €320,000 cited in Dublin for those who have been refused loans by the banks According to the Irish Independent's How Much Is Your House Worth 2018? which values all homes nationwide (now available online at independent.ie) , €320,000 currently buys a two-bed cottage in Dublin 8 (€320,000), an ex Corporation two-bed terrace in Dublin 16 (€310,00), a one-bedroom apartment in Dublin 4 (€320,000), a three-bed semi in Dublin 22 (€280,000), a two-bedroom apartment in Dublin 13 (€290,000) or a two-bedroom apartment in D1, Dublin's north inner city (€320,000) . However, for the same price of a D1 two-bed, you can own a 15-bedroom mansion in Roscommon measuring 10,529 sq ft - or 10 times the size of an average city family semi - and still have change of €20,000. To demonstrate the massive value gap that now exists between urban and rural properties, Independent Property set out on a virtual mansion shopping tour with €320,000 to spend and with the goal of finding ten mansions with not less than six bedrooms for the price of that D1 city apartment or less. Most need work, some need use change, one has lease complications on an attached property and some are in isolated locations; but all are huge homes with at least six bedrooms attached and all can be bought for €320,000 or less 1.
