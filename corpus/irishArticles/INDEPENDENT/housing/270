THE commuting boom around Dublin dramatically transformed many tiny villages in Kildare and Meath into huge population centres with new housing estates, an official  report confirms. A quarter of the entire housing stock in Co Kildare was built in the six-year period from 1996-2002, overwhelming many r villages. The Central Statistics Office (CSO) report reveals that an amazing 70pc of all the houses in Sallins, Co Kildare and Ratoath, Co Meath were built during this same period. There were 1,083 houses in Ratoath in 2002, quadrupling the number of people living there. Some 757 houses were built after 1996 many in suburban style housing estates. To put this in perspective, just 304 of the 1,083 houses in Ratoath were built in the decades prior to 1995: before 1919 some 15 of the 1,083 houses were built; 1919-1940 just 10 houses; 1941-1960 just 18 houses; 1961-1970 a total of 17 houses; 1971-1980 a total of 58; 1981-1990 some 42 houses, and 1991-1995 144. Then, between 1996-2002 there was the boom with 757 houses. The popular canal-side village of Sallins saw 666 new houses pop up, again mainly in suburban type estates, bringing the total housing stock to 927 and also increasing the population four-fold. The growth of houses follows a similar pattern here. Out of 927 houses the history is : Before 1919 - 27 houses; 1919 to 1940 - 17; 1941 to 1960 - 38; 1961 to 1970 - 32; 1971 to 1980 - 47; 1981 to 1990 -22; 1991 to 1995 - 48 houses. Then the big boom from 1996 to 2002 saw a massive 666 new houses built. The report gives a clear picture of how the growth of housing in towns and villages which remained relatively low from 1919 until the early 1970s really took off from 1996. A total of 623 houses were built in Donabate between 1996-2002; 358 in Portarlington; 1,619 in Dundalk; 2,721 in Drogheda; 1,540 in Mullingar; 544 in Maynooth; 888 in Balbriggan and 1,379 in Celbridge; 1,543 in Newbridge; 1,681 in Naas; 2,672 in Navan and 791 in Wicklow; 866 in Skerries; 666 in Dunboyne. Many of those who moved out to commuting towns did so because houses were cheaper than in Dublin. Yesterday, Eamon Gilmore, Labour's environment spokesman, criticised the Government for what he described as "seven years of inaction on controlling the cost of building land." It follows reports that large numbers of families cannot afford mortgage repayments as house prices in Ireland are now the most expensive in the EU. Mr Gilmore said the huge increase in the cost of building land was the main cause for spiralling house prices and insisted that the Government had persistently blocked any attempt to tackle this. "Prices continue to increase at more than four times the current annual rate of inflation. "Most people's incomes will rise only at or around the level of general inflation so families seeking housing will still find a huge gap between what they can afford and what is available," he added. He said that in 1997 when the Coalition took office house prices were in line with the cost of building land, average earnings and inflation. "In the intervening seven years they have allowed the gap to emerge whereby prospective house buyers are completely priced out of the market," said Mr Gilmore.
