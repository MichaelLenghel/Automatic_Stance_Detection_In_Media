Eat, sleep and retreat in some of Ireland's most individual hotels. Simon Haden's family has been running Gregans, located in the heart of The Burren, since the 1970s. The rooms are tasteful and luxurious, the staff delightful, and the surroundings unbeatable in terms of views, flora and fauna. Gregans has a reputation for exciting food, and guests can expect menus that draw on an abundance of fantastic local ingredients and offer something a little out of the ordinary. Walkers and nature enthusiasts are well catered for, as are those who would prefer simply to sit by the fire, read a book, and soak up the loveliness of it all.

The in-house Morrison Grill has a Josper grill and serves a mean steak.

 Twelve Hotel, Galway / For a small hotel, The Twelve has a lot going on. Located just 10 minutes outside of Galway city centre, there's an in-house bakery, an excellent restaurant, West, and a wine cellar crammed with the kind of treasures that you'd expect to find in a far more snooty establishment altogether. The Twelve has won the Wine Spectator Award for eight years running and numerous other awards for the calibre of both food and wine. There's also a mini-spa with treatments using the seaweed-based Voya products.

A continental breakfast is delivered to each room and hung on the door, so there's no pressure to get up early, or endure the torture of breakfast with strangers, and everybody talking in hushed voices. Book in either for a meal or a course, such as the Three-Day Intensive aimed at proficient cooks who want to be challenged, being held from September 14 to 16, with instruction from Paul Flynn himself and local legend Michael Quinn.

Located in the heart of the Georgian Quarter, close to the shops, culture, and the famous Milk Market, with stylish rooms, a more than decent restaurant, a great spa and convivial rooms for the taking of tea and the drinking of pre-prandial cocktails, this is a gem. The staff are local and lovely too.

If you can put the ridiculousness of that to one side, The Merchant is well located for exploring the hip Cathedral Quarter, with its numerous bars and restaurants and The MAC arts venue.

 Tourism Draw: The Lodge at Ashford Castle  / While Ashford Castle itself is undeniably grand, The Lodge at Ashford Castle next door, originally built for the estate manager in 1865, is a smaller and less formal proposition with individually designed rooms all with deep-pile carpets, super king beds with goose down duvets and pillows and up-to-the-minute technology. The Lodge's new restaurant, Wilde's, is garnering positive feedback and offers chocoholics a special chocolate-focused afternoon tea - Tumbling through Truffles - featuring a dramatic chocolate bomb, broken open at the table to reveal a secret stash of sweets (mini-brownies, chocolate ice-cream, macaroons and truffles), accompanied by a chocolate shooter - either virgin chocolate or with Frangelico. Where: Cong, Co Mayo Details: (094) 9545400, thelodgeac.com Price: Room rates average €195 in October If Ballynahinch is associated with one thing, it's fishing. Keen anglers return year after year in the hope of catching the elusive salmon. Recently refurbished, the hotel smacks of low-key luxury, and attracts the great and the good of Irish society. You never know who you might find nursing a pint and swapping tales from the riverbank in the wood-panelled Fisherman's Bar, with its record books of fish landed going back hundreds of years. Some of the rooms have extraordinary views over the water, and they are comfortable and plush in a way that would encourage you to stay for more than a night.

Neither should you be deterred by the notion of glamping, because Justin and Jenny Green run a superior class of operation here, and their tents and yurts are almost as comfortable as the bedrooms in their very lovely house. If you can, though, snag an indoor bedroom and prepare to spend a couple of days relaxing on the oversized sofas in front of proper log fires, reaching for tea and home-made bakes if you get a little peckish, and one of Justin's signature rhubarb martinis when the sun is over the yardarm. Dinner is served at a communal table in a proper dining room, and it's very good country house fare. Where: Castlelyons, Fermoy, Co Cork Details: (025) 36349, ballyvolanehouse.ie Price: A two-night romantic escape with B&B, half a bottle of champagne and dinner on one night costs from €255pps

 Cliff Townhouse / It's hard to conceive of a better location for a smart Dublin city centre boutique hotel than that of The Cliff Townhouse, a sister property to The Cliff House in Ardmore.

Baggot Street itself has plenty of good pubs and restaurants, and the Aviva is a short stroll away too, making the Dylan a great choice for matches. All the rooms are pretty swanky, but the Signature features a hand-carved Italian wooden bed that looks as if it might have served time on the set of a Tim Burton movie.

 Ballyfin House / Ballyfin is the most expensive hotel in Ireland, and probably not somewhere that you are going to run off to for a weekend on a whim.

Where: Glasson, Athlone, Co Westmeath Details: (090) 6439010, wineport.ie Price: Dinner, B&B from €239 in October The Allen family probably doesn't think of Ballymaloe as a boutique hotel, but if a boutique hotel is small and perfectly-formed, with personal rather than anonymous service and something unique about the way in which it goes about its business, then Ballymaloe definitely qualifies. Hooray for the absence of televisions from the comfortable bedrooms, and hooray again for delicious, home-made food that epitomises the very essence of Irish country house cooking, with many of the ingredients coming from the Ballymaloe farm and local artisan producers. Be sure to bring elasticated-waist trousers.
