In all NAMA is currently offering buyers its price guarantee or, as it is officially known, the 80:20 deferred payment initiative, for as many as 254 homes ranging in size from two to five bedrooms. These include 74 homes which were included in the first phase last May but have not yet been sold. To date 41 of the NAMA homes have either been sold or sale agreed, many of them at the Killeen Castle development in Dunshaughlin, Co Meath. In all buyers can chose from 24 developments in 12 counties. Most people buying with a mortgage from next month onwards could find it practically impossible to meet the December 31 deadline which the Government has set for the ending of mortgage tax relief for purchases. To meet the deadline they would need to select one of the houses and pay their deposit within the next two weeks. Then they would need to go through the whole legal process of completing the sale, which some buyers find can take months. A spokesman for NAMA was somewhat vague about any special arrangements for buyers to meet the December 31 deadline saying NAMA "has no role in assessing, approving or facilitating the drawdown of mortgage applications but it (NAMA) will work with debtors and participating lenders to complete sales as quickly and efficiently as possible". He explained its delay in bringing its second tranche of homes to the market as being due to the need to establish whether the first phase "was achieving its objectives before a decision could be taken by the NAMA board to roll out the initiative to more properties. "The inclusion of additional properties was also dependent on getting the agreement of the debtors who own the properties to participate in the initiative." Only a few houses are available at two of the four Dublin developments. At Brown's Barn Wood on the Naas Road, Dublin 22, two of the four-bedroom terraced houses are available through Sherry FitzGerald at €295,000 and €300,000.
