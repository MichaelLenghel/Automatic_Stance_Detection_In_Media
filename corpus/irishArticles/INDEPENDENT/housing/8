Dublin couple John and Eva met at a mutual friend's birthday.  They chatted that night and when John finally asked her out, Eva decided "for no reason at all" that she didn't like him!

 / After months of bumping in to each other and John trying his best to charm her, Eva said she still wasn't conviced. John even asked her over several times more to no avail. However, one magical bank holiday the two ended up sitting together at a bar, and after just a few minutes of chatting it finally hit her - she had John all wrong. Not willing to admit her mistake though, when he asked her out again, Eva said no (imagine! the poor guy!) She came to her senses a few days later and finally asked him out, and the rest, as they say...

 / The couple tied the knot in Killester Church before heading to Bellinter House in Navan for their wedding reception.  Eva wore a dress by Claire Pettibone, which she purchased with the help of Meghann at Myrtle Ivory ("she said 'this will be your dress'!"). The bridesmaids wore mismatched gowns from ASOS (styled to absolute perfection!) and John wore Paul Smith from Louis Copeland. They planned a "relaxed, fun" wedding with "plenty of food, laughter and dancing". Their theme was 'better together'.John and Eva's photography was by Ten Twenty One Photography and their videography was by Cinematic Tide.

 / John and Eva got engaged while they were on holidays in Vietnam, after a day of dinner and cocktails in Hoi An. "We had a lovely day on a cooking class followed by dinner and cocktails," said Eva. "That evening we took a little wooden gondola down the river and John got down on one knee. It really was very sweet." The couple viewed two venues before they visited Bellinter House when they said they knew they 'hit the jack pot'. "We just loved everything about it. The feeling of calm, exclusivity, quirkiness, design detail, food and the intimacy. It was everything we wanted and more. The food was a huge selling point for us."

 / Eva wore a dress by Claire Pettibone which she bought in Myrtle Ivory. "I walked into the shop and Megan took the dress off the rail and said this will be your dress," said Eva. "It was the first dress I tried on it was just perfect. I of course tried on 10 more to be sure." The bridesmaids wore different dress styles, all from ASOS. "I went for FOUR completely different dresses. Each suited the bridesmaid and their personality. I loved it! They were all so comfortable and looked brilliant.

 / "The colours from the four dresses were all tones from the palette I used for the day. The flowers and guys ties brought it all together." The couple brought a woodland theme to the room at Bellinter House. They built handmade candelabras with wooden sticks and long stem candles which were then weaved with foliage and placed on large wooden slices. They also had grey table cloths and the room was dressed in white drapes with warm toned up lighters. "It looked really fab," added Eva.

 / Their theme was 'better together' and each table was named after people or things that are better together eg. Fish and Chips. Their first dance was Better Together by Jack Johnson. "We strung colourful carnival lights around the patio and had our first dance outside. It was a really mild evening and worked out perfectly. We danced while are guests waved sparkles and swayed along. It went in a blink. We loved every minute of it. We look back and remember smiles, processco, dancing, music and spending it with all the really special people in our lives. My favourite memory is Just married, leaving the church and cruising along with the roof down on the convertible car waving to our guests."

It really didn't add to the day and a lot of people didn't realise it was there." John and Eva went on an eight week 'honeymoon of a lifetime' beginning in Sri Lanka, through Singapore, New Zealand, Australia and finishing in Dubai; "It was amazing. We did everything from 5 star Hotel to sleeping in a campervan."

 / "Enjoy every minute. Don’t stress the detail and pick a chief runner  Sarah was  my chief runner/ hero. There are so many jobs to do the day of the wedding and often the bridal party can’t disappear to do them. Sarah, my brothers wife, was titled my chief runner and  was just amazing." Online Editors
