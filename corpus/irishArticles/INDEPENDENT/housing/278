A dozen contestants have signed up for the latest series of Celebrity Big Brother. Here are the famous faces entering the house.  Linda Nolan enjoyed chart success with hits such as I'm In The Mood For Dancing and Don't Make Waves, alongside her sisters, under the name The Nolans. They made their TV debut in 1974 appearing on a Cliff Richard show, and after releasing cover versions they went on to score their biggest hit in 1979 when I'm In The Mood made the top three. Nolan went on to have a musical theatre career with appearances in shows such as Blood Brothers, Pump Boys And Dinettes and Prisoner Cell Block "H". She was treated for breast cancer in 2006, the same illness which claimed her sister Bernie last year.

The tap-dancing star was born in Canada but came to live in Britain from the age of two onwards and his earliest public performances took place as he sheltered from air raids in the Second World War. He studied ethnography at university but followed his passion for musical theatre and dance and, although he chalked up some acting credits, he carved out a career as a choreographer, befriending figures such as Sammy Davis Jr when they worked together. The 82-year-old has been coy about his age and has said: "I am 59 plus VAT."

 Lionel Blair enters the Celebrity Big Brother House  Getty Images / Liz Jones is a journalist and columnist whose controversial views have raised the hackles of many and she has been publicly blasted by figures such as Rihanna and Phillip Schofield. A one-time editor of Marie Claire, she claimed she developed anorexia before her teens and claims she was removed from her post on the magazine because she refused to use models with eating disorders. Jones earned a rebuke from Schofield for her criticism of his fellow This Morning host Holly Willoughby for not wearing make-up, and she upset singer Rihanna by calling her a "toxic role model for her army of young fans". She chronicled her four-year marriage to fellow journalist Nirpal Dhaliwal in uncomfortable detail and later claimed to be dating a rock star. Despite polarising opinions with her views she was named columnist of the year at the British Society of Magazine Editors Awards in 2012. Luisa Zissman was runner-up in BBC1's The Apprentice last year, losing out to friend and rival Leah Totton. She developed her business nous by setting up her cupcake business in Hertfordshire and a baking website, and the mother of one displayed her own buns by posing for nude pictures which found their way online. Zissman found further notoriety when it emerged she had been a regular visitor to upmarket sex parties. On joining The Apprentice last year, she said of herself: "I have the energy of a Duracell bunny, sex appeal of Jessica Rabbit, and a brain like Einstein.''

As a youngster she showed promise as a gymnast and underwent intensive training but she broke her arm twice which led to her scaling down her Olympic ambitions. Faiers - whose on-off relationship with co-star Joey Essex has been followed by Towie viewers - had hoped to be a Page Three girl before finding TV fame and says she would still like to model for lingerie firm Ann Summers. Although she has agreed to appear on Celebrity Big Brother, she said in one recent interview: "I don't just want to be known for being a reality TV star. I'd love to be on Strictly or I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!"

Dappy, real name Costadinos Contostavlos, is well known for his woolly hat and prominent neck tattoo which reads ''RIP Dad''.

His act has attracted headlines for the wrong reasons with critics regularly accusing him of pedalling a bigoted brand of humour - a charge he denies. Last year, Davidson was told that he will face no further action in the UK after previously being arrested on suspicion of historic sexual offences.
