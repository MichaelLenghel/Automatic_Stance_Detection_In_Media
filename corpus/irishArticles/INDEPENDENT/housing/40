It's been a strong autumn season to date for new home schemes, particularly in Dublin and the greater Dublin area, with some new developments selling out in the first week of their launch.  One such was the first phase of 30 houses in the Parkside development at Malahide Road,  which were all sold at the launch, selling agents Hooke & MacDonald report. Another 30 have now been released still at launch prices, from €299,000.  It all points to bottled-up demand, most particularly from first-time buyers and those downsizing. However, those who have delayed their foray into the market in the hopes of changes to Central Bank lending regulations or positive Budget measures for home buyers will find that they haven't missed the boat. There is a steady flow of launches to come through the rest of October and November. This weekend, for example, Sherry FitzGerald launches a development of 114 houses by Gannon Homes with the first phase of 40 three-bed houses at Belltree in Clongriffin in north Dublin. They are aimed at first-time buyers and the development will feature a range of two- and three-storey units. Prices start at €260,000. A development by Ballymore of large three- and four-bed houses at Royal Canal Park in north Dublin at Ashtown, also with Sherry FitzGerald, launches at prices yet to be confirmed at the end of the month. Over the month of November, DNG will launch a bespoke scheme of five luxury houses aimed at the top end of the market at Temple Road in Dartry. Many of the details have yet to be released but they report that already one of the five homes is under offer.   A development of three- and four-bed houses  at Oldcourt in Ballycullen will be selling off plans from mid-November and, according to selling agents DNG, is appealing to those upsizing from two-bed apartments or duplexes.  Cooper's Wood at Kinsealy, which launched earlier this season with Savills, unveils a number of premium four-bed houses in a quiet cul-de-sac, over the next few weeks.  Further afield in Galway, the first phase of the Knocknacarra development of 73 three- and four-bed houses at prices from €239,500 to €320,000 was sold out within two weeks by joint agents Sherry FitzGerald and O'Donnellan & Joyce. It was the first development for some years in the Galway area and Sherry FitzGerald reports that interest came mainly from first-time buyers and families trading up. Next week Galway also sees the launch of An Fearban, a scheme of just seven four- and five-bed detached houses at prices from €535,000 to €625,000.  In Cork, a number of developments is launching with a scheme of 24 houses by O'Leary & O'Sullivan at Ard na Coille in Mayfield seeing its first phase of 10 three- and four-bed semis selling at €239,950 and €274,950. A little further out of town a scheme at Drom Sli near Blarney, with five houses in a development of 32, reaches the market with four-bed houses at prices from €294,950 and €334,950.
