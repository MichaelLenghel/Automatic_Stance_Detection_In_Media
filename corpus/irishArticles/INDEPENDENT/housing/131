The home that featured in the Academy Award-winning film ‘Silence of the Lambs’ has hit the market in Pennsylvania USA, but its owners are surely hoping it won’t draw any aspiring Hannibal Lecters. In the 1991 film, which scooped Academy Awards for both Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins, the Victorian house is portrayed to be that of Buffalo Bill, a psychopathic criminal who abducts and murders women. The role was was played by Ted Levine. Although the film suggests the three-storey Victoria House might be a moth-riddled hellhole complete with a dungeon, the reality is anything but with bright, airy rooms and a luxurious private swimming pool. According to the Pittsburgh Tribune Review, the home’s current owners Scott and Barbara Lloyd (63) placed the property on the market after four decades. The couple, who married in the home’s foyer, were approached by a film scout in 1990 who convinced them to allow their home to be the scene for one of most influential horror films in history. The film’s Hollywood crew took six weeks to transform the house, which is 30 miles south of Pittsburgh. While the couple have grown to love the home’s claim to fame, they are hoping to downsize after more than 40 years. The couple have placed 8 Circle St on the market for an asking price of $300,000 (€250,000).
