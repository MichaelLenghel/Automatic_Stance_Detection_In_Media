David and Kelley Quigley's character-filled wedding at Segrave Barns started with a 'first look' for the bride and groom and finished with their guests dancing long into the night at the beautiful new alternative wedding venue in Louth. The bride wore a pair of €5 earrings she got the day before in a nearby chemist, and she had her sister try the dress on instead of herself. She did her own hair, and finished her look off with a gorgeous pair of shoes from ASOS - adding a pop of colour with red lippy and some vibrant red nails.

 / After their 'kitchen table' proposal, the couple went about planning a completely 'chilled out' ("if there is such as thing," Kelley jokes). They had their Humanist ceremony in the Ashtree Barn stables (with Sharon Patterson as celebrant), after a very sweet 'first look' moment which was captured beautifully by photographer Andrew Byrne. The caterers at Segrave served a buffet style dinner, which the couple loved as it gave lots of choice for their guests.

 / John and Eugene at Seagrave 'took care of all the details' which meant the couple were free to enjoy the full occasion, which they did over three days in June.  "We knew what we didn’t want and that was a church service and a hotel reception," says Kelley of their wedding venue, "so when we found Segrave Barns it ticked all the boxes! Laid back with lots of character."

 / The couple managed to stay stress free before the day by having very little to do when it came to planning for the venue, which added to their overall enjoyment of the run up to the day, as well as the weekend itself. "We had nothing to do to the venue as the guys that own it John and Eugene took care off all the details," says Kelley. "They did everything for us, they are amazing guys!" Kelley wore a stunning long sleeved lace dress from BHLDN - an online bridal boutique from the company behind labels such as Anthrolpologie and Urban Outfiitters. "My sister lives in nyc so she went to one of their stores and tried it on for me! We ordered it in my size and my sister brought it home for me!

 / "Mad I know but I loved it..." "As we had the venue for a few days," says Kelley, "we stayed together the night before our wedding, so when we woke up the morning of the wedding, it was lovely to have that time together before everyone started arriving"
