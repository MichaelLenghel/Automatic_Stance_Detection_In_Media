Fancy your own Blue Book bolthole in the woods? Kevin and Catherine Dundon's Dunbrody House has added a novel accommodation option - a 'Cosy Cabin' in the Wexford woodlands. The hideaway is a stone's throw from the country house hotel, set near the herb garden overlooking the valley down to Arthurstown Harbour. Decorated in New England style with one double room and two singles, rates start from €150 to €195 per night sleeping up to four people (room only).

Dunbrody (dunbrodyhouse.com) a member of Ireland's Blue Book, has evolved at a pace since it opened in 1997, adding a spa, cookery school and, in recent years, its own pub - The Local - together with craft beers from Arthustown Brewing Co. In 2016, the country house hotel was named Luxury Country House of the Year by the Luxury Travel Guide. The Cosy Cabin follows a growing trend around Ireland for luxury properties to add or restore smaller boltholes on their properties - from Dromquinna's €350-a-night glamping hideaway to private cottages costing €2,000 and €3,000 a night respectively at Ballyfin and Ashford Castle.  Guests at the Cosy Cabin - be they couples, or a "girly getaway" - can escape from it all, the Dundons say, or dip in and out as they choose.
