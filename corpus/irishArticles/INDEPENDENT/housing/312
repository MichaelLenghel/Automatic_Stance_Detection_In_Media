A British woman who painted her house with red and white stripes after her neighbours refused her multi-million pound extension has been ordered by the council to paint it white. Zipporah Lisle-Mainwaring (71) hired painters to decorate her house in garish stripes after the neighbourhood in Kensington, London refused her plans to build a five-storey city mansion with a underground pool. Kensington and Chelsea Council has ordered the woman to repaint the house white after they received a barrage of complaints from neighbours who described the house as an eyesore. The 71-year-old faces prosecution should she fail to comply with their request by July 3. A spokesperson for the council said: “The property is situated within the Kensington Square Conservation area and its condition and appearance has attracted numerous complaints to the council’s planning enforcement team. “In addition to the exterior being painted red and white stripes, the property’s window frames are in poor condition,” the spokesperson added.

 A red and white striped house in South End, Kensington, London, which was apparently painted by the owner in protest at a planning application being turned down on improvements to the property.  PA / The neighbours are all horrendously unhappy with it. Everyone's complained. “We all hate it. It's a bit of an eyesore,” resident Saskia Moyle said. “The woman who owns it put in a planning application to go down two floors but it was rejected and now we think she's trying to do this so the council is forced to demolish it. “She wants to demolish it and re-build it which would take about six years and that will be a nightmare. It will apparently be worth £25million but that seems slightly unnecessary. "She knew by painting it that she'd get a reaction because it's a conservation area. “They painted it in less than a day. They came quite late one evening and by 11pm they were done. It's not even finished. They missed the top right-hand corner by the lamppost.” Lisle-Mainwaring submitted an application to knock the current building and erect a super city mansion with a basement that delves two floors beneath the surface. The plans to build the five story mansion which would house a basement pool, four bedrooms and a media area, were rejected by the district’s residents.
