  Christina Noble at the IFTA Awards 2015 at The Mansion House Pictures: VIPIRELAND.COM / The glitzy awards show was formerly screened on RTE but changed to the rival broadcaster after last year's ceremony was branded a "shambles". This year's awards were broadcast on Monday night and pulled in an average of just 121,100 viewers compared to 382,000 on the national broadcaster last year - a difference of 260,900.

  Sean Bean at the IFTA Awards 2015 at The Mansion House Pictures: VIPIRELAND.COM / The ceremony, which was held on May 24, was well-received in comparison to last year after the academy decided to hold two separate events for film and television. While A-list stars like Jamie Dornan and Colin Farrell failed to turn up on the red carpet, winners included Irish stars like Charlie Murphy and Sarah Greene. Meanwhile, the awards also had less viewers than Pat Kenny's interview with Shane Filan. Pat Kenny in the Round had lost viewers since it started last month.
