If there was one thing we could have expected from Meghan Markle in all the furore of royal wedding planning, it's that she would choose a chic, elegant, exclusive place to throw a low-key but high style hen party. Which is why when we heard she and her close pals chose to keep her bridal shower very hush in the ultra plush, private members' club the Soho Farmhouse for her ultra relaxing hen weekend, we were not hugely surprised. It is believed Meghan and her 'bride's tribe' planned their secret getaway at the 100-acre estate deep in the Oxfordshire countryside last Sunday, where they were awarded the ultimate in privacy at the four-bedroom Farm Cottage, reserved just for Meghan and her mates. According to OK! it was Meghan's close pal Markus Anderson - a consultant at the Soho House Group - who organised the lavish lunch for the girls in the exclusive cottage which sits away from the main club house. Markus was in attendance on the day, as was Meghan's LA based pilates-instructor friend Heather Dorak, and close pal New York TV producer Lindsay Jill Roth (for whom Meghan served as maid of honour in 2016). The bride's squad reportedly didn't avail of the acclaimed spa on the premises, preferring instead to concentrate on a good old-fashioned catch up. As well as a five star spa, Soho Farmhouse boasts several fine dining options and an on-site food truck. It has two swimming pools, a nearby lake and a private cinema. Meghan and friend Millie Mackintosh, who was reportedly not in attendance, stayed at the farmhouse in 2016 and were pictured riding bikes together.

 / Which got us thinking - where could we find equally exclusive country houses to rent in Ireland to mirror Meghan's ultra cool shower? Of course, we didn't have to look too far... Dunowen House as a luxury coastal escape on the Wild Atlantic Way. The property dates back to the 1770s and as the home of Jimi Hendrix’s base guitarist Noel Redding for 30 years, it has oodles of rock and roll character that sets it apart from other historical country estates.
