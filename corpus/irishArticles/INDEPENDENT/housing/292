Already completed are 24 houses at Ferdia Park Phase 1V, 18 houses at Castlebellingham, 11 houses at Tallanstown Phase 11, 12 houses at John Kirk Park Phase V, 7 houses at Omeath Phase 11, 20 houses at Dunleer Phase 111, and 16 houses at Tallanstown Phase 111. Thirty-six houses at Blackrock Phase 1 are currently under construction while tenders have been accepted for 34 houses, including 8 affordable houses, at Sean O’Carroll St., Ardee, 28 houses at Termonfeckin and 9 houses at Castlebellingham Phase 11. Approval is awaited from the Department of the Environment for 32 houses at Louth Village. The Council purchased one house as part of the programme. There are 457 people on the Council’s housing list. Of these 25 per cent are one person households, 37 per cent two person households, 19 per cent three person households and 19 per cent four or more person households. The fact that 62 per cent of the list is made up of one or two person households will require the Council to build a higher proportion of two bedroomed houses in future. A number of voluntary housing schemes are also in progress in the county. These include the twelve unit development at Grange which is nearing completion. Work is also under way at the eight unit Foscadh development in Collon. Discussions are taking place regarding the layout of the 70 unit Oaklee development in Ardee, while discussions are on-going regarding the design of other schemes at Tullyallen, Ardee and Dromiskin.
