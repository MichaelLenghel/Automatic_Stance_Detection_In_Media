Chris and Niamh knew each other since childhood, through Niamh’s cousin.  They hadn’t seen each other in years yet a random meeting at a party in 2009 marked the beginning of their romance.

 / “We were visiting friends in the UK in 2014 and decided to travel there by ferry. "We went out on the top deck and Chris asked me to look overboard to see if I could see any fish on the way into the harbour! I turned around and he was down on one knee proposing!”

 / They celebrated a few weeks later by cutting an area of a corn field by Chris’s home, putting up a marquee and having a big party. Afterwards friends kept asking. “How are ye going to top that?”Photos by Berit Alits Photography

 / The couple fell in love with Ballintaggart House as soon as they saw it, captivated by the 'relaxed, rustic feel' and the idea that they would have the space all to themselves for the entire weekend's celebrations. 'John and Clodagh in Ballintaggart House were amazing. We trusted them 100%, and could not have planned the day without them.' The couple chose a rose gold and blush theme to tie the bridal party and decor together.

 / "I chose a rose gold and blush theme which ran from the bridesmaids’ outfits to the lanterns from Penneys. We had a mojito station for the ladies and a ‘beer barrow’ for the men. Niamh wore a Gemy Maalouf gown which featured trumpet sleeves. "I toured the country looking for something different" she said.

 / "We decided not to have any speeches as we didn’t want to put pressure on the best man or our fathers. Jimmy, a family friend, wasn’t happy with this and hijacked the microphone! He is a bit of a joker and had everyone in stitches, even telling the bride about what Chris got up to as a youngster... He then chased Chris’s dad around Ballintaggart House with the mic, insisting he says a few words!" "It may have been a little dull and blustery up the Conor Pass but the craic was mighty with our 160 guests. The whole weekend was just amazing. We spent three days with our closest family and friends. On the morning of the wedding, my Dad gave me a pair of gold earrings that belonged to my grandmother. It was from that moment that I knew it was going to be an emotional day."

 / The couple's first dance was to Chantal Kreciazuk’s Feels Like Home. "Having a small baby puts everything into perspective. We tended not to stress about the little things; as long as baby Fia was happy, we were happy. Our friends and family helped out an awful lot, especially with childcare!"

 / "Choose suppliers that you know and trust. My sister got married a few months before us so she gave me plenty of tips. I chose the same church music and band because they had a great reputation." "We travelled around Portugal, along the coast from Lisbon to Vilamoura for 10 Days. Fia flew over for the last five days."
