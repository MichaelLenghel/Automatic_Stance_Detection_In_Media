US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton accused China of trying to "hack into everything that doesn't move in America." Speaking at a campaign event in New Hampshire, the front-runner to win the Democratic nomination said Chinese hackers had stolen commercial secrets and "huge amounts of government information." "We have to be fully vigilant, China's military is growing very quickly, they're establishing military installations that again threaten countries we have treaties with, like the Philippines because they are building on contested property," said Ms Clinton, who was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. "They're also trying to hack into everything that doesn't move in America. Stealing commercial secrets ... from defense contractors, stealing huge amounts of government information, all looking for an advantage," she said. Asked about the remarks, a White House official declined to comment. In the most recent case involving suspicions of Chinese hacking, officials have said China is the top suspect in the massive hacking of a US government agency that compromised the personnel records of at least 4.2 million current and former government workers. China has denied hacking into the computers of the US Office of Personnel Management. Reuters
