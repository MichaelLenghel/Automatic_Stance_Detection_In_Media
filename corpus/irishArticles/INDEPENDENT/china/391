A landslide hit the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen in Guangdong province on Sunday, burying 22 buildings and leaving 27 people missing, state media reported. A nearby section of China's major West-East natural gas pipeline also exploded, the official China Central Television (CCTV) broadcaster reported. Hundreds of rescuers sifted through rubble looking for survivors after the landslide struck Shenzhen's Hengtaiyu industrial park in the city's northwestern Guangming New District in the morning, the official Xinhua news agency said. Four people have been rescued from the debris, with three sustaining minor injuries, it said, citing rescuers.
