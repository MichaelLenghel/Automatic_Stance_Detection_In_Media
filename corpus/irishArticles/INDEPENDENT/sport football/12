THE Herald School Sports Awards said goodbye to one of its most prominent performers at the annual awards ceremony at the Aviva Stadium yesterday. Síofra Cléirigh Buttner was there for her sixth year in a row, with the 2012/3 Star of the Year's achievement recognised with the inaugural Herald School Sports Special Achievement Award. An incredible ambassador for her  school Coláiste íosogáin of Booterstown, Síofra was quick to heap praise in their direction.  “We have a few award winners here today and there is so much opportunity in the school for getting involved in sport and there are loads of different sports to play,” she said. And it was a day to remember for íosogáin.

 Des Cahill / Their senior ladies football team created history last month when they became the first Dublin school to capture the All-Ireland senior A football title and were duly recognised with the team of the year award. They also scooped the overall Sports Star of the Year when the star of that side Isolt Ní Riordáin was chosen from what is always a competitive category. The Kilmacud Crokes star played down her own achievements by paying tribute to her team: “It's brilliant to win this award. But gaelic is a team sport and that's what it's all about.” With Leinster and Ireland rugby star Devin Toner the honorary guest, it was fitting that his sport was also prominent. Peter Smyth, head coach in Blackrock College, led the school to Senior Cup success. Paddy Maher of Dunshauglin capped his fine year, which culminated in SIAB Schools International Cross-Country success in Bolton in March, by taking home the Star of the Future award. And fittingly, in the year that marks their 50th anniversary, St Aidan's Whitehall were crowned the 2014 Herald School of the Year after a phenomenal season in GAA, athletics and golf.   2013/14 award winners TEAM OF THE YEAR (A) Herald Deputy Editor Alan Steenson presents Team of the Year award to Coláiste íosagáin’s Senior Ladies Football team, (l-r) Isolt Ní Reardáin, ladies footballer, principal Fíona Uí Uiginn, Alan Steenson, and Cathal Pleineann, coach.  school of the year (B) Herald Deputy Editor Alan Steenson presents School of the Year award to St Aidan’s Whitehall, (l-r) Brendan Harrington, principal, Micheal McCafferty, teacher, Alan Steenson, and Cathal Doran, 17, student.
