THE Athletics Association of Ireland (AAI) felt the pinch when the Irish Sports Council announced grants of ?6.73m to National Governing Bodies yesterday. For the first time in many years the AAI does not top the annual list of NGB grants and its latest allocation plummetted ?124,000. However, the AAI's grant will be reviewed as soon as they have completed their current internal reorganisation and appoint a Chief Executive, a process that the Sports Council has enforced upon them in recent months. Athletics traditionally gets the biggest NGB grant in the country - and still gets a considerable ?340,547 - but Special Olympics Ireland is the big winner, topping the chart with just under ?500,000. An increase of almost ?200,000 has been designated to support Special Olympics Ireland's 'Go! Campaign', designed to help bring 4,000 new athletes into sport over the next two years. Volleyball, motorsport, equestrian sport, mountaineering and camogie are others whose grants have improved by ?20,000 to ?30,000 while basketball, boxing, and deaf sports are amongst those who have dropped. Wheelchair athletes also get a big boost with a jump in their funding of ?56,659, the second largest increase. And while athletics are currently under the microscope, Swim Ireland, whose grant was initially upheld last year, has received a slight improvement in its ?375,750, which includes support for a new Director of Education post and two administrative assistants. Basketball, which got a huge allocation last year for major restructuring, is still second highest but also shows the second largest decrease, down by ?112,000. Boxing's core grant is down by almost ?40,000 and and funding for deaf athletes is also down by a similar margin, though theirs was unusually high last year to cover the World Games. Six sports, including women's gaelic football, have not get received their allocations as they have still to complete outstanding administration work. Ladies gaelic football is likely to be one of the sports who will also benefit when a new ?750,000 initiative for 'women in sport' is distributed this year. The NGB grants do not include monies for individual 'high performance' schemes (including the 'carding' scheme for elite international athletes) which are expected next month. The new-look professional administration of Irish sport is reflected in 188 full-time and 45 part-time staff being employed in the 59 sports covered. A percentage of the allocations go towards their salaries. The NGB grants never include the 'big three' team sports of gaelic games, soccer and rugby because the Sports Council believes that their competitive structures are self-financing. But GAA, rugby and soccer traditionally get funding for their development programmes separately, apart from additional grants under the Government's capital (building) grants. One noticeable change is that the ISC have targeted a new list of 16 'focus sports', which will get additional funding under the 'high performance' system because of their ability to bring international success. These are specified as athletics, badminton, cycling, equestrian, the Golfing Union of Ireland, boxing, rowing, canoeing, clay pigeon, hockey, ladies golf, sailing, Taekwondo, swimming, tennis and fencing, whose NGB grant has doubled to ?26,000. Tennis Ireland's grant includes ?28,000 for club development programme and ?23,000 to go to wheelchair and mini-tennis. Sailing's ?248,956 includes ?175,000 specified for administration. The Rowing Union's decision to appoint a CEO is singled out and badminton has received ?21,900 specifically for youth and club programmes with ?2,500 for a disability initiative. Volleyball's grant is up to support a new schools programme, Motorsport Ireland's is up by ?21,000, with ?50,000 for their Young Driver scheme. The Irish Snooker and Billiards Association, who hosted the World U21s in Carlow last year, have received ?56,975 to employ a full-time Youth and Development Officer.
