AIDAN QUIRKE (OYLEGATE-GLENBRIEN) Aidan Quirke from Ballydonfin near Glenbrien was a stonewall and uncomprising defender for his club, Oylegate-Glenbrien. When playing at right halfback, a position he usually occupied during his career, he was reliable and steadfast. All through his years he displayed remarkably high levels of dedication, resolve and skill. His smooth, sublime skills in lifting, controlling, handling and striking the ball were absolutely superb. In his No. 5 jersey his tight, vigilant covering and his clever play left very little for his opponents to take advantage. With his unhurried style, his calm demeanour, his composure and vision he was always a foot or two ahead of his opponent. He was born in 1941 and was educated at Glenbrien N.S. and Enniscorthy V.S. His boyhood hero was Nickey Rackard R.I.P. Aidan's finest hour playing with Oylegate-Glenbrien was versus Rathnure in the 1963 Co. Senior hurling semifinal. In that game, playing at right half-back, his judgement, his skill and control were excellent and he epitomised all that is splendid and constructive in good defending. His first-time clearances had length and direction. In a dazzling display one of his greatest attributes was his ability to read the game and his awareness when in possession of the ball, to allow one of his forwards to benefit from his clearances. Sadly, after a knee injury in 1964 he had to retire from the game he loved and his loss to the club was immense. There was so much hurling left in this outstanding player. The three hurlers he would select as the best he has seen over the past 40 years, excluding Oylegate-Glenbrien players, were Liam Dunne, Tony Doran and Mick Jacob. He was a selector and Chairman for his club. The best dual player he has seen in Wexford was Paddy Kehoe (Gusserane). He first played Intermediate with his club in 1959. His brother, Michael, also played Intermediate hurling. The four players he selects as the best he has seen playing with Oylegate-Glenbrien were Pat Nolan, Mick Bennett R.I.P., John Nolan R.I.P. and Ned Hanlon R.I.P. The four players he selects as the most difficult that he played on in his hurling career were Oliver McGrath, Paul Lynch, Dick Murphy and Martin Nolan R.I.P. (Blackwater). The three players he selects as the best he has seen in Wexford while hurling were Billy Rackard R.I.P., Tim Flood and Mick Jacob. His dad and uncle Mick played Minor hurling with Killisk, The Ballagh, in 1928. He was a substitute on the Wexford Minor team in 1959 and in a National League match with Wexford Seniors. He won one Co. Intermediate medal in 1959 and one Co. Senior medal in 1963, both with Oylegate-Glenbrien. The best game of hurling he has seen in Wexford was Rathnure versus St. Aidan's in the 1955 Co. Senior hurling final. He played Minor hurling with Ardcolm in 1958 and 1959. The most exciting game of hurling that he played in was Oylegate-Glenbrien versus Shamrocks in the Echo Shield in 1963. The best club team he has seen in hurling was Rathnure in the early '70s. The best goalie he has seen was Pat Nolan (Oylegate-Glenbrien). He also played football with his club until his injury. Of the present-day hurlers, Tommy Walsh (Kilkenny) and Joe Canning (Galway) stand out. AIDAN ROCHE (CLONGEEN/GLYNN-BARNTOWN) Aidan Roche, who now resides in Ballygoman in the parish of Glynn-Barntown, was for almost 26 years a top-class dual player. Originally from Little Cullenstown, he was a much-travelled player in his long and distinguished career. He started off playing Juvenile hurling with Camross in 1953 and 1954 and Juvenile football with St. Munn's in the same years. He played Minor as in Juvenile, and his first adult game was in 1958 with the above clubs in Junior. In 1960 and 1961 he played with Gusserane O'Rahilly's and from 1962 until 1975 he was playing with Clongeen. Finally from 1976 until 1984 he was a regular in both hurling and football with Glynn-Barntown before he retired at 44 years young. In hurling his favourite position was right half-back and in football he played everywhere including in goal. In hurling he was a master of all the skills as his speed, his fleetness of foot, his balance, his ball control and vision combined with his consummate ability were features which endeared him to friend and foe alike. He was born in 1940 and was educated at Little Cullenstown N.S. His two boyhood heroes were Nickey Rackard R.I.P. and Padge Kehoe R.I.P. His finest hour in the hurling jersey for Glynn-Barntown was in the Co. Junior hurling final versus Ballyfad in 1976. At wing-back he gave a brilliant performance, and his ball control, his clean striking and his long clearances were highlights of the hour. The best dual player he has ever seen in Wexford was Martin Quigley. The two best dual players he has seen in Ireland were Des Foley R.I.P. (Dublin) and Jimmy Barry Murphy (Cork). Aidan's medal collection was one Co. Junior football (Clongeen, 1970), one Co. Junior hurling (Glynn-Barntown, 1976) and one Co. Junior football (GlynnBarntown, 1982). This was added to with District and league medals too. He also played for the New Ross District teams in hurling and football. His two brothers, Michael R.I.P. and Seán, also played hurling and football in their careers with Clongeen. He was a selector many times with his club, a Secretary in Clongeen, Treasurer with Glynn-Barntown, Chairman with Bord na nOg, trainer and selector many times with the Co. hurling and football Under-14 and Under-16 teams, and successfully trained many hurling teams in GlynnBarntown.

The two hurlers he selects as the best he has seen in Wexford were Padge Kehoe and Nick O'Donnell. The best game of hurling he has seen in Wexford was the Senior final with Rathnure versus St. Aidan's in 1955. ALO DOYLE (FERNS ST. AIDAN'S) Alo Doyle, originally from Ferns and now living in Gorey, was for a number of years an outstanding footballer. He was an elusive and crafty forward whose speed allowed him to outsmart and outwit a number of his markers. He played most of his football in the half-forward line, where he could show off his fleetness of foot combined with his intelligence and excellent balance which made him pass his markers repeatedly. He started his career playing Juvenile hurling and football in 1951. He played both grades in Minor hurling with Ferns and football with the famous Young Irelands in 1952, 1953 and 1954. They reached the Co. Minor football semi-final in 1951, but lost out to Geraldine O'Hanrahans. Alo came on as a substitute. He came back to Ferns to look after the family business and got back into the frame with Ferns again. From the mid '50s unitl 1965 he was a regular member of this team in both Junior and Senior football. He was born in 1936 and was educated at Ferns N.S. and St. Peter's College, Wexford. His boyhood hero was Fr. Rory Deane. He was on the Ferns committee for a few years. His late brother, Brendan, also played for Ferns. The two best dual players he has seen in Wexford were Tom Guinan and Paddy Kehoe. Of the present-day footballers playing with Wexford he selects Redmond Barry, Ciarán Lyng and Colm Morris as the best. In Ireland, Colm Cooper (Kerry) stands out as one of the greatest to play football, while Peter Canavan (Tyrone) was another gifted player. When Alo was in St. Peter's College the footballer who stood out was John Gallahue who was a class act in the No. 6 jersey. His finest hour playing with Ferns was versus Castletown in a tournament final played in Bellefield which they won. Ferns had a surprise win and he excelled in this encounter. His speed of thought, his pace and flair were first class. He got a Co. Minor football trial with Wexford in 1953. The greatest display he has seen in hurling was given by the late Bobby Rackard versus Cork in 1954. Alo was on the Ferns Senior football panel which lost two Co. finals in 1954 and 1955. The best individual display he has seen at club level was by Pa Plummer at centre-back in the 1954 Co. Senior football final versus Gusserane. The four footballers he selects as the best he has seen playing with Ferns were Tom Furlong R.I.P., Pa Plummer, Mylie Breen R.I.P. and Micheál O'Neill.

Minor semi-final against Geraldine O'Hanrahans (New Ross) in 1951. ANDY CARTY (DAVIDSTOWN/CLOUGHBAWN) One of the truly outstanding backs to play for Davidstown-Courtnacuddy and later with Cloughbawn was Andy Carty who is originally from Courtnacuddy but is now residing a few miles from Clonroche. He was never one for the rough stuff. He was a gentleman and still is on and off the field. He always believed in playing the game even though his opponents could never manage to get away from his vice-like grip that was part and parcel of this wholehearted and dynamic defender's game. He excelled in close exchanges and was hardly ever beaten for possession, and his clearances were long and well directed. One of his finest games playing with Davidstown-Courtnacuddy was versus Buffers Alley in the 1963 Co. Intermediate hurling final. In this encounter he showed immaculate courage, had a high level of skill, was fiercely competitive and was completely on top in his duels with his opponent. Andy's overall performance in this game was brilliant. His tackling, blocking, striking and clearing were out of the top drawer. He was born in 1941 and was educated at Courtnacuddy N.S. His boyhood hero was Tim Flood. The best dual player he has seen in the county was Phil Wilson. He played with Davidstown-Courtnacuddy from 1959 to 1969 and with Cloughbawn from 1970 to 1979. The best individaul display he has seen was by Mick Jacob in the 1974 Co. Senior hurling final - Oulart-The Ballagh versus Rathnure. He won All-Ireland and Leinster medals in Intermediate with Wexford in 1964 playing at left cornerback. This was memorable for him to bring home those coveted medals. At club level he won two Intermediate hurling medals in 1963 and 1973, and two Junior honours in 1961 and 1972, with Davidstown-Courtnacuddy and Cloughbawn. He was a selector and committee member with Cloughbawn. He had one brother, Jim, who also played.

The most exciting game of hurling that he played in was Enniscorthy District versus Rathnure in the Co. Senior final in 1971. The best goalie he has seen was the late Ollie Walsh. BEN NOCTOR (KILANERIN) Ben Noctor who now resides in Kilmurry just outside Gorey town is one of the longest-surviving Kilanerin footballer that played with the club. Apart from his family, football was his life and he enjoyed every game he played in. His dedication to the sport was unreal. In 1957 while working in Galway he would finish work at 4 p.m. on a Saturday and then he had to go home and get ready to catch the 6 p.m. train to Dublin, getting there around 10 p.m. His brother, Jack, came up from Wexford to meet him on his motorbike and it would be 12 midnight when they arrived home. He was up next morning for 11 a.m. Mass, then off to play football and then back Monday morning to Galway. How many players today would do a similar journey to play the game? While in Galway he played with the Fr. Griffiths and did his training with the Co. team. He was born in 1927 and was educated at Kilanerin N.S. His boyhood hero was the late Nickey Rackard. The two best footballers he has seen outside of Wexford were Seán Purcell R.I.P. (Galway) and Frankie Stockwell R.I.P. (Galway), a combination that could open up any defence. The two greatest dual players he has seen in Ireland were Michael 'Babs' Keating (Tipperary) and Des Foley R.I.P. (Dublin). The best under-age player he has seen was the late Dermot Earley from Roscommon. CONTINUED OPPOSITE BILL MURPHY (BUFFERS ALLEY) One of the most gifted and stylish hurlers to come on the scene in the '60s and early '70's was Bill Murphy. The Buffers Alley craftsman had speed, skill, ball control and above all super vision. He was a natural performer on the hurling field and many of his markers found themselves chasing shadows. Bill was lithe, clever, calm and cool and was always able to find the open spaces. His breathtaking scores from all angles and all distances were hallmarks of a master-class player. Every time he gained possession he bore down on his opponents' goal like a whirlwind and every move he made spelt danger. He was a supreme sportsman and never resorted to any foul play. His contribution to his beloved Buffers Alley was immense and he gained respect and admiration from friends and foe alike. He was born in 1938 and was educated at Monamolin N.S. His boyhood hero was Nickey Rackard R.I.P. His brother, Jim, was also an outstanding hurler with Buffers Alley and received a Seana Ghael award in 2010. One of the great goalkeepers he has seen was Pat Nolan (Oylegate-Glenbrien). The best dual player he has seen in Wexford was Oliver Cullen (Liam Mellows and Castletown). The two best dual players he has seen in Ireland were Teddy McCarthy (Cork) and Liam Currams (Offaly). One of the best club teams he has seen in Wexford was Buffers Alley, with Rathnure a close second. Bill first played Junior hurling with Buffers Alley in 1955 and last played with them in 1973.

Senior hurling title in 1968, and when they won All-Ireland Club honours in 1989. He selects Tony Doran as a special individual in the club, a great leader and motivator. BILL WHITTY (ST. FINTAN'S) Bill Whitty, who now resides at Ballyknocken in Rosslare Harbour, was a longterm player and supporter with the St. Fintan's club. He is still very much interested in the affairs of the G.A.A. in the county and travels to most games in Wexford Park. He first played Junior football with St. Fintan's in 1955 and his last game with them was in 1961. He played with St. Mary's (Rosslare) in 1962,1963 and 1964 and he retired shortly after this. He played Juvenile football with St. Fintan's in 1950 and 1951 and Minor football with the club in 1952 and 1953. He normally played his football in the left half-forward position where his speed, self-belief and composure were features of his play. Bill's finest hour in the St. Fintan's jersey was versus St. Munn's in the Wexford District Junior football championship playing in the half-forward line. He was in great form, winning possession repeatedly and bringing his fellow forwards into the play to carry on his good outfield work. Bill was born in 1935 and was educated at Tagoat N.S. His boyhood hero was Willie Goodison R.I.P. The best dual player he has seen in Wexford was George O'Connor for St. Martin's. The best dual player he has seen in Ireland was Des Foley R.I.P. (Dublin). The best dual player he has seen with the St. Fintan's club was Nicky Newport. The most exciting game that he played in was versus St. Munn's in 1961. It was so close and competitive that the result was in doubt until the final whistle. Bill remembers one of the best games of football that he has seen was the 2011 Co. Senior football final when Horeswood defeated Castletown, and also the game between Tyrone versus Wexford in the 2002 qualifier in Wexford Park. Of the great Wexford team in the '50s his favourites were Bobby Rackard R.I.P., Nickey Rackard R.I.P., Ned Wheeler and Tim Flood. Bill was overjoyed when St. Fintan's won the Co. Senior football championship in 1980, defeating Half Way HouseBunclody in the final.

His favourite position when playing was wing-forward. In football the best goalie he has seen in Ireland was John O'Leary (Dublin). BILLY MURPHY (ST. PATRICK'S) Billy Murphy, who now resides at Ballydaniel a few hundred yards from the village of Camolin, was a lifelong supporter of the St. Patrick's (Ballyoughter) hurling and football clubs. He was born in 1936 and was educated at Camolin N.S. His boyhood hero was the late Nickey Rackard. He started his career in the Juvenile grade in 1951 and 1952, playing hurling and football with the Valley Rovers, and continued on to play Minor in both hurling and football in 1953 and 1954 with the same club. He played his first Junior hurling game in 1955, also with the Valley Rovers. In 1956 the club changed its name to St. Patrick's (Ballyoughter) and Billy continued to play in a number of positions with them until the mid-'60s including lining out in the goal. One of the most exciting games he played in was in 1960, with St. Patrick's winning by 4-7 to 3-1 versus Kilanerin. Billy was outstanding in goal. His finest hour in the St. Pat's jersey was versus Buffers Alley-Kilmuckridge 'B' team in 1958. When playing at left corner-forward he bagged himself two great goals and saw another two efforts coming back off the post. In that game he proved a big headache for the opposition. Billy was a selector for a number of years with St. Pat's, including when his team lost two Co. Junior hurling finals in a row in 1974 to Monageer-Boolavogue and 1975 to Blackwater. He was Chairman of the club in the 1990s for a few years and was a committee member for many years. He selects the late Oliver Murray and Richie Blake as the two greatest officials he has ever seen in organising and controlling affairs. Both made the Gorey District what it is today, a master set-up. The best dual player he has seen in Wexford was Phil Wilson. The best footballer he has seen in the Gorey District was Bill Owley while the best hurler was Oliver Gough. The best dual player he has seen in Ireland was Ray Cummins (Cork).

He never won any medals, but he enjoyed every game in both codes. The best game of hurling he has seen in Wexford was Rathnure versus Buffers Alley in the 1988 Co. Senior final drawn game. DAN HARRINGTON (SARSFIELDS) From the time he arrived in Wexford from Cork in 1972, Dan joined up with the Sarsfields club. He was an outstanding and dedicated addition to the set-up. In his capacity as an official and committee member he was ever ready to fulfil whatever obligations that were entrusted to him. Every spare moment Dan had he gave to the club willingly. He had the utmost respect for the Sarsfields' top members like the late, great 'Chief' Seán Siggins, the late Jim Crowley, the late Pa White and Jas Kirwan along with another number of lion-hearted workers. It was a great privilege, said Dan, to be associated with such renowned individuals and with such an excellent club. He was born in 1931 and was educated at Rockwell College. His boyhood hero was the late Tadhg Crowley who was captain of the great Cork team which won the All-Ireland Senior football title in 1945.

They won so many Senior football titles during that time. Dan played hurling and football with Tig Malaga (Timoleague) in Cork, winning a medal with the club in 1952. His role with the Sarsfields was an exemplar one - Co. Board rep. for seven years., Senior selector for two years., Chairman of the club for one year, committee member for 35 years and Vice-President at the present moment. He was a steward in Wexford Park for 38 years, and with the Wexford Senior footballers he was their kit man for 26 years.

The four footballers he selects as the best he has seen playing with the Sarsfields over the years were Jas Kirwan, Billy Dodd, John Harrington and Ger Halligan. In under-age he would select John Curtis, Liam Bent and Jim Roice as being superb. All of his four sons - John, Paul, Martin and Noel - played with the Sarsfields, with John and Paul playing with the Wexford Seniors. John had many, many outings with the Wexford Senior team. DANNY KIRWAN (ST. BRENDAN'S CRAANFORD) Danny Kirwan, who lives just a few miles from Gorey town, was in his playing days a stylish and wholehearted hurler with Craanford St. Brendan's. He played most of his hurling at right half-back where he always played his heart out with the club. He was very disappointed when his team lost a game. When playing in his role as a defender, his marking was tenacious and quick and he was fast to cover his patch when danger threatened. Danny always remained calm and unruffled and his clearances out of defence were always well directed. He was a player with excellent spirit, courage in abundance and grim determination. He was born in 1936 and was educated at Loreto Primary School and Gorey C.B.S. His boyhood hero was Nickey Rackard R.I.P. His brother, Brian, received a Seana Ghael award in 2011. He played Juvenile and Minor football with the Rockies in the early '50s. His first adult club was Kilanerin and he moved over to play with Craanford in 1957.

The two best dual players he has seen in Ireland were Jimmy Barry Murphy (Cork) and Des Ferguson (Dublin). The best goalie he has seen in hurling was Tony Reddan (Tipperary). He played Junior hurling with Kilanerin in 1955 and 1956. On the great Wexford team of the '50s the three players he admired most were Nickey Rackard R.I.P., Jim English R.I.P. and Ned Wheeler. One of his finest games playing for Craanford was versus Kilanerin in the Gorey District hurling championship in 1959. He played an outstanding role in defending his lines and his overall performance was in the top bracket. One of the finest individual performances he has seen at club level was by Tommy Whitty at midfield for Craanford versus Ferns in round two of the Gorey District Junior hurling championship in 1956. The best club team he has seen over the years were Rathnure that won four Co. Senior hurling titles in the early '70s all in a row from 1971 to 1974 inclusive.

Of the present-day hurlers the three he selects as the best are Tommy Walsh (Kilkenny), Henry Shefflin (Kilkenny) and Noel McGrath (Tipperary). The four hurlers he selects as the best he has seen playing with Craanford were Mylie Donohue, Red Mick Sullivan, Dan Byrne and Dan Kenny. The four hurlers he selects as the most difficult that he played on while playing with Craanford were Pa Grannell (Gorey), Paddy Sinnott (Buffers Alley), Patsy Morris (St. Patrick's) and Har Doyle (St. Patrick's). The three hurlers he selects as the best he has seen in Ireland were Pat Stakelum R.I.P. (Tipperary), Willie John Daly (Cork) and Jimmy Doyle (Tipperary). The most exciting game he has seen was the 1968 Co. Junior hurling final when Craanford beat Na Fianna. One of his favourite full-backs in hurling was the late 'Diamond' Hayden (Kilkenny). The late Jim Doyle of The Glen was a great club official. DICK DILLON (KILMORE) Dick Dillon, who lives in Mulrankin near Bridgetown, was one of the club's best dual players with St. Patrick's (Kilmore) - as a player, as an official and as an administrator they didn't come any better. His willingness to go through fire and water for the good of his beloved Kilmore was very admirable. He commanded his position in the full-back and half-back lines with total conviction. Dick combined great skill with the right attitude and with his tight, vigilant covering left very little leeway for forwards to take advantage.
