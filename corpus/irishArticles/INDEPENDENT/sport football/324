Athletics: Lusk - There were three races in the Rock n Roll series over the weekend and club members were involved in all three. There were course changes from previous years, with the Half starting at Kilmainham Hospital and the 10k at DIT Grangegorman. Both Sunday's races finished at Kilmainham. There were some brutal hills in both races, with the Half being a particularly challenging course. On Saturday Jamie Cruise ran 20:25 at the 5k event and then followed it up on Sunday with a super 1:40 at the Half-Marathon. There were other great performances by Lusk athletes and excellent support out on the course from other club members which was greatly appreciated.
