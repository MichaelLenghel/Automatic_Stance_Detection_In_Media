alan.aherne@peoplenews.ie  1 - Seán O’Kennedy Stood apart as one of the great inspirations of his era both as a player and trainer. One of the heroes of Wexford’s All-Ireland Senior hurling win of 1910. He later captained Wexford to win the first three of their four successive Senior football titles from 1915 to 1918. Seán was District and County Secretary for years, a selector and referee, and also county manager for a few years prior to his death in June, 1949. An outstanding player and administrator, the pitch in his native New Ross was re-named from Barrett’s Park to O’Kennedy Park shortly after his death. He was the father-inlaw of another man who features on the football and hurling top 125 lists, Billy Keilthy. After coming to Wexford town to work in 1930, Seán gave tremendous service to the Sarsfields club.  2 - Paddy Kehoe He played for his county in all grades of hurling and football. First appeared as a Minor in both hurling and football in 1940. Appeared with both Junior sides in 1942, played Senior hurling in 1943 and Senior football in 1944. Won a Leinster Senior football medal in 1945 and played for his province in football in 1949. Also played hurling for his province in 1946 and ’53. Played with Wexford in three hurling finals, 1951, ’54 and ’55, and was a substitute in ’56. By 1955 he had played 13 years with Wexford footballers. One of the great footballing forwards never to win an All-Ireland.  3 - Matty Forde The county’s only All Star footballer. No player has scored more in championship history for his county. Yet another great forward never to win a provincial or All-Ireland medal in any grade. His dominance in attack helped to bring some glory back to Wexford football when they qualified for the 2008 provincial final and All-Ireland semi-final. Also figured in a Division 1 National League final. Oozes skill on the ball, while his scoretaking from any distance and angle marked him out as one of the great forwards of the current era.  4 - Michael Carty Had the distinction of captaining U.C.D. to success where he won the admiration of no less than Eugene McGee as a special footballing talent. Equally at home in defence, midfield or attack, he had such a reputation as a player that he was looked upon as a ferocious competitor, great fielder and skilful on the ball. Would have made any inter-county side in the country during a distinguished playing career.  5 - Dermot Clancy An outstanding midfielder in Wexford’s first Leinster championship win in 20 years in 1945. Lost out to Cavan in the All-Ireland semifinal. Featured in an astounding comeback against Offaly in the 1948 provincial championship. Ordained that morning, he arrived at half-time and, partnering Nickey Rackard in midfield, inspired one of the great comebacks. The Ballinglen clubman’s time was short with Wexford following his ordination. Brought high fielding to a special art and was one of the finest outfield players to wear the purple and gold.  6 - ‘Tearin’ Tom Doyle He lived up to his name during the golden era of Wexford football, winning four All-Irelands from 1915 to ’18. Helped to forge the beginning of a golden era with outstanding midfield displays. Always looked capable, with the skill and ability to take on the opposition, providing the forwards with the ammunition for those golden scores.  7 - Willie Goodison An outstanding centre-back. One of the best the game has known, helping Volunteers to record-breaking successes and winning Leinster Senior football honours in 1945. Had a fine record with Leinster in the Railway Cup, and played on the Ireland team in 1950 and 1952. Also a distinguished referee, he held the whistle for the 1955 Kerry-Dublin All-Ireland final, and refereed a football league final, Dublin v. New York.  8 - Jim Byrne Carlow-born, he captained the 1918 All-Ireland winning team on the retirement of Seán O’Kennedy. Also won a Leinster Senior football title in 1925. A national school teacher, he became the proud holder of seven Senior provincial medals. His performances in the 1915-’17 All-Ireland successes made him the ideal choice to captain the 1918-winning team. A man considered ahead of his time.  9 - John Morris Every famous player is remembered for his flashes of genius on the field, his match-winning feats, his total commitment to club and county. The Volunteers clubman is such a player. Helped to form an all-Volunteers half-back line along with Willie Goodison and Jackie Culleton in winning the 1945 provincial title. A footballing stylist from wing-back, he achieved great success with both club and county.  10 - Nickey Rackard Made 25 championship appearances between 1942-’55 over a 14-year span. Outstanding both at midfield and in attack, he contributed a total of 6-13 during his footballing career, with 5-9 coming from play. Became legendary during his hurling career, but his best achievement on the football field was helping to pull down an Offaly eight-point lead in the Leinster championship at Dr. Cullen Park with only eight minutes left, having switched to midfield at half-time. He was a midfielder and cenre-forward before becoming a leading full-forward in both codes. Played for Leinster in both football and hurling.  11 - Fr. Edmund Wheeler The Glynn and Ballyhogue clubman had a distinguished career in the 1910-’17 era. A giant of a player, he was a colossus at fullback during that golden era. Such was his reputation for his outstanding footballing ability that he was feared by all forwards. Always rock solid but with a flair for outstanding individual brilliance, he was one of the great full-backs of his era.  12 - Jack Fane One of Wexford’s Tailteann Games footballers with Ireland in 1932, he played with the Volunteers, Sarsfields and Taghmon clubs. Helped to form a new midfield pairing with Paddy Bailey for the 1926 Leinster final against Kildare which they lost. He went on to become one of the outstanding midfielders despite a barren era for Wexford football.  13 - Fr. Rory Deane During his short career, Rory represented his county in the Minor, Junior and Senior championships, but was never once on a winning side. Special permission from his ecclesiastical superiors was obtained to enable him to play in the 1953 provincial final, the second of just two championship appearances. Ordained in 1954, he was posted to Corpus Christi, Texas, depriving club and county of an outstanding footballer.  14 - Rich Reynolds He was among the many heroes of the fourin- a-row All-Ireland winning side. The diminutive wing-forward featured in what was a lethal attack, and he was described as one of the best forwards in the game at the time. He fully merited the accolade with a string of outstanding displays. He enjoyed a total of 36 championship appearances in a ten-year career spanning 1910 to ’20.  15 - Paddy Mackey Played in the 1910 Senior hurling final and also the four-in-a-row football successes. Along with New Ross colleague, Seán O’Kennedy, they became two of a dozen players in all who won All-Irelands in both codes. Mackey played in six successive football finals, winning four. Kilkenny-born, he was a corner-back in the traditional mould and made the position his own, being one of the most consistent players in the side.  16 - Dermot Redmond It’s common enough for hurling balls to go through nets, but the only player ever known to do likewise with a football in thousands of games played in Croke Park was Starlights attacker Dermot Redmond. He performed this feat playing with the Wexford Junior football team in a win over Meath in 1926, and spectators, team-mates, opponents, referee and umpires could hardly believe that it had happened. One of the top footballing talents to emerge from Enniscorthy.  17 - Seamus Fitzhenry He may not have enjoyed inter-county silverware, but the measure of the player was how much he played despite Wexford’s struggle to reach the top. A superb half-forward, he was a crucial player in that record-breaking Duffry Rovers outfit. Was one of the game’s great forwards, a ballcarrier, finisher and play-maker, all rolled into one.  18 - Jack Berry Another one of the county’s great dual players. Won an All-Ireland Senior hurling medal in 1968, but football was his first love. A superb free-taker while also explosive from play. Known to have played both National League hurling and football on the same day. His greatest contribution was when he played in a hurling league game in Gorey, and immediately swapped his jersey to line out with the footballers afterwards, scoring 3-11 against Kilkenny.  19 - Martin O’Neill In a lengthy career on the playing fields, he played left full-forward for Ireland twice against America in the Tailteann Games of 1928 and ’32. Also played for Leinster. Won a provincial Senior football medal in 1925, Junior hurling in 1926, and an All-Ireland Junior football title in 1936. Refereed the only All-Ireland Senior football final to be played outside the country, in the Polo Grounds, New York, in 1947. A long-time Secretary of the Leinster Council.  20 - Jackie Culleton Played with U.C.D., Volunteers and Camross. An outstanding defender with the 1945 Leinster- winning Senior football team. Hugely versatile, he always exerted a huge influence on the game.  21 - Aidan Doyle Like all players from that golden era, he contested and won four All-Irelands in a row. Will always be remembered for his versatility and ability to turn a game.  22 - Jamesie Nolan One of the greatest all-round footballers ever to come out of Enniscorthy. Played Minor, Junior and Senior football for his club in the one year, 1928. In the 1930s he played soccer with West Ham reserves before returning home to end his playing career with Emmets.  23 - Jim ‘Sacker’ Furlong Played all four games in the marathon Wexford- Carlow football championship first round in 1941. Like so many of his colleagues, he was renowned for his high fielding and general outfield play. Enjoyed great success with Sarsfields and Volunteers but died when still in his sporting prime.  24 - Tom Somers Played in all four games against Carlow in 1941. Enjoyed a great inter-county career spanning from 1939 to ’47. A colossal presence on the field, he was deceptively quick. Also enjoyed considerable success with Gusserane O’Rahillys.  25 - Frank Furlong Had few peers at midfield. Showed an ability to get forward to pick off points as he contested three All-Ireland finals from 1915 to ’17. The Wexford town man was a superb twofooted player in a key position.  26 - Seán Turner A member of the 1956 football team which lost the Leinster final to Kildare. No player gave more to Wexford football through what was to become a dormant period for the game in the county. Set a very high standard, with his fielding and kicking skills the features of his all-round talents.  27 - Gus O’Kennedy Played through the golden era of Wexford football, winning All-Ireland titles from 1915 to 1918. Was renowned for his almost unerring accuracy, underlining the nerves of steel he possessed.  28 - Jonathan Moriarty The Sarsfields clubman played inter-county football through the years 1934 to 1939, including the Leinster Senior football final defeat to Meath in 1939. His reputation as an outstanding footballer stood the test of time.  29 - Nick Stewart Represented his county on eight occasions between 1918 and 1921. Played in the last of the four-in-a-row sides of 1918 when they defeated Tipperary in the All-Ireland final. Making his Senior debut that year, he went on to become part of history and a permanent fixture in the side. A full-back whose influence was profound.  30 - Martin Howlett Played his club football mainly with Kickhams and Gusserane. Won All-Irelands with the historic Wexford team in 1915, 1916, 1917 and 1918. One of the most stylish players in the team.  31 - Nick Walsh Enjoyed a remarkable career in a span from 1922 to 1934, making a total of 29 championship appearances. A member of the defeated Leinster finals team to Dublin in 1924 after a replay. His long range overhead kicked point is still talked about which brought the final to a replay. The Ballyhogue clubman was one of the great players of his era.  32 - Paddy Mythen Played 17 times in a span from 1932 to 1934, including the 1932 Leinster final loss to Dublin after replay. Showed great ability as a footballer and later as a referee, taking charge of three All-Ireland Senior finals in 1941, 1944 and the 1945 replay.  33 - Davy Morris Scored an astonishing five goals in the first round win over Laois in 1932. Was a member of the team which ended the great Kildare side’s 24-match unbeaten run in the same year. Made a huge impact on the inter-county scene as a forward of real talent.  34 - Billy Howlin Snr. From the famed Volunteers club, he played inter-county from 1938 to 1944. Played in the 1939 Leinster final defeat to Meath. Stood apart for his skill and ball play and provided an intelligent presence in attack.  35 - Patrick Byrne The New Ross clubman was a colossus and played inter-county from 1924 to ’30, figuring in 19 championship games. Was on the 1924 Leinster final losing team to Dublin. Also played in the 1925 All-Ireland semi-final loss to Mayo, and provincial final defeat of 1926 to the Lilywhites of Kildare.  36 - Paco Sheehan Played Senior inter-county between 1951 and 1958. Featured in the Leinster final defeat to Kildare in 1956.

The New Ross player made ten appearances between 1924 and 1926. Was on the defeated Leinster final side of 1926 to Kildare. Also played in the 1925 All-Ireland semifinal defeat to Mayo in which he scored 1-2. A player considered ahead of his time.  38 - John O’Gorman An ever-present at full-back from 1984 to 1997. Played his club football with Taghmon- Camross and Kilkenny side Dicksboro. The dominant figure on the fringe of the square, giving courageous and skilful displayes in what was a great career.  39 - John Doran The Ballyhogue clubman made 14 appearances between 1918 and 1930. Brought into the 1918 All-Ireland winning side when they completed that historic four-in-a-row. Made his Senior debut that season and became an ever present in the side. The enforcer in the engine room of the team, a player of great allround talents.  40 - Redmond Barry His performances for both club and county have marked him out as a player of real presence and talent. Made his Senior debut back in 2001, having played under-age for Wexford. One of the great leaders in the current side and a playmaker of considerable quality.  41 - Jack Crowley Won All-Ireland Senior medals as part of the great four-in-a-row side. Played in the 1916, 1917 and 1918 All-Ireland wins. Made a total of 28 appearances in a span from 1910 to 1924. His performances in those three finals are still spoken about.  42 - Dick Walsh Enjoyed an inter-county career spanning from 1919 to ’28. Member of the Wexford 1924 team which lost the Leinster final to Dublin, and the side that went down in the 1925 All- Ireland semi-final to Mayo. The Ballyhogue clubman was a pivotal force in the team.  43 - Denis Asple Played Senior inter-county from 1966 to 1975, making a total of 15 appearances. Enjoyed a stellar career as a centre-back both for his county and club, Ballyhogue. A defender in the traditional mould, you would struggle to find a more consistent player.  44 - Andy Merrigan A colossus of a midfielder, his untimely death in a farming accident robbed football of an outstanding player. Dominated games on his own with his sheer energy and ball-carrying ability. He may have gone on to greater things but for that accident.

Was a pivotal force in the Wexford sides during that era. His strength and ball-winning ability marked him out as one of the county’s leading midfielders.  48 - Martin Cummins The Ballymurn man was one of the great dual players. He played some 20 times in a span from 1897 to 1906, captaining the side on many occasions during that time. Played with the Blue and Whites in the Leinster final defeat of 1898 when the game was 17-a-side. Captained the Croke Cup winning team of 1897, defeating Cork in the final. Pencilled in as a real leader of his time.  49 - Andy Doyle May be more spoken about for his 4-2 in a Senior hurling championship game against Kilkenny, but rose to fame as a man mountain on the fringe of the square for Wexford and Leinster in the ‘big ball’ code. One of the great full-backs to emerge from the Taghmon club.  50 - Stephen Hayes Made 26 championship appearanaces between 1924 and ’33.
