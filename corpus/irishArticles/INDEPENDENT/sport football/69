Athletics, Lusk. It was a super morning in Phoenix Park on Saturday for the Irish Runner 5-mile RACE which also incorporated the National 5-mile Championships.   Lusk AC had 19 athletes taking part and there were great performances in the breezy conditions. Johnny Holland continued his run of form with a brilliant 29:10, with Garrett Loy also running well with 30:29. It was also nice to see some of our newer members taking part, including some former Fit4Lifers Jackie Moore and Samantha Murtagh stepping up in distance. Special mention to Helen Whearity who was making her first appearance in the Lusk AC singlet and was first of the Lusk ladies in 38:40. Well done to all. Results: Johnny Holland 29:10, Garrett Loy 30:29, Sean Greensit 32:41, Richard Foy 33:39, Stephen Murtagh 33:48, Jamie Cruise 34:03, Colm De Bhal 34:21, Helen Whearity 38:40, Gerard Kearney 40:51, Gavin Fogg 41:03, Carol McAlpine 41:28, Abby Chung 43:35, Sarah Waldron 44:55, Jackie Moore 45:15, Veronica Brogan 46:14, Paul Wylie 47:56, Samantha Murtagh 53:01, Colin Browne 54:35, Nicole Hodson 54:50 pacer. Even the wet weather couldn't prevent a fantastic Dublin Graded Meeting 4 on Wednesday night in Santry. It was also Dublin Championship night and Lusk AC got stuck in with the best of them.  Orla Smith, Eamon Gahan and Colm McNally took part in the 100m, recording close to their best times. Meanwhile, Shane and Adam McNally were inside taking on Ireland's best vaulters. But it was over at the shot putt circle where Lusk recorded medal success. Colm Donoghue, Eamon McBride and Eamon Gahan recorded a one-two-three sweep of the medals in the Seniors, while Colm McNally recorded gold in the O-50 Masters. Earlier, Eleaina Gahan returned to competition and went home with gold. Everyone in the shot putt recorded new personal best distances, showing that our throws initiative is beginning to bear fruit.  Colm Donoghue moved to the hammer later in the evening and came home with a bronze also. Well done to Eddie Hamilton on completing another marathon on Saturday in a time of 4:44:30. The EoI Curragh marathon is run mainly on grass and was Eddie's third over the 26.2-mile distance in just over two weeks. Well done to all those who participated in or volunteered at last weekend's parkruns. Francis McCullagh recorded the fastest time on Saturday, running 19:19 at Omagh, and in doing so lowered his overall parkrun PB. Martin and Susan McDevitt were also in Ulster, both setting new PBs at Limavady.  The Russell family made it a family affair by all running at Donabate where Aidan Russell and Cian Harpur both recorded PBs. On Sunday, Peter Ryan achieved his fifth PB from his last six parkruns. Results: Omagh - Francis McCullagh 19:19. Ardgillan - Mark Geraghty 22:22, Stephen Magee 27:35. Limavady - Martin McDevitt 27:00 PB, Susan McDevitt 31:37 PB. Donabate - Aidan Russell 21:30 PB, Cian Harpur 22:17 PB, Rodrigo Lara 22:42, Trevor Russell 23:18, Des McNally 23:57, Geraldine Halpin 29:35, Elba Vargas-Russell 34:15, Carolina Russell-Vargas 34:17. River Valley - Matt Wade 37:13. Rush junior - Oliver Bush 10:00, Peter Ryan 10:35 PB, Alexa Holland 10:38, Michael O'Reilly 11:35, Dillon Wylie 12:29, Sam McGaffey 12:59, Caleb Nolan 15:03, Enda O'Reilly 15:12, Odhran O'Reilly 17:47, Eli Bush 18:33.  In the Dublin Juvenile Track & Field Championships at Santry on Friday, Lusk athletes performed really well in the shot putt and turbo javelin, with Eimear McBride taking gold with a great throw of 25m, and in the relays we had a full complement of girls running which was a first for the club and great to see. The younger girls stayed on to watch the older girls and what great role models they are to the younger juveniles. The U-12 Boys ran really well and just missed  out on the final. Out of the six relay teams, four made the finals and no medals came home but all performed superbly. Days 4 and 5 saw another great weekend of action from Lusk in Santry, with all-round great performances from everyone who took part in all the events. Not everyone can take home a medal, but the guts and effort from those that didn't is as good as a medal.  Our results were as follows:  U12 Eimear McBride Gold High Jump & Shot Putt U12 Jack Walsh 4th National qualifier. U13 Kathy Rigney Silver High Jump. U15 Juliette Kodia Bronze 250m hurdles. U16 Kirsty Seaton Gold 80m & 250m Hurdles. Ellen Gahan Silver High Jump & Bronze Shot Putt. Cara McNally Bronze 250m Hurdles & 4th 1500m national qualifier. U17 Grace McKenna Silver Shot Putt Gold Discus. U18 Grace Codd Gold Triple jump. Kevin Halpin U19 Gold Discus. What was lovely to see was the massive support that was there from all the juveniles. From Friday's relays to the last triple jump on Sunday they were still there cheering their clubmates on. A big thanks to all the helpers on the sidelines keeping all the kids warmed up and over to the events they were in, and to the club's officials who gave their time to help out and make the day's events run as smoothly as possible. Congratulations and well done to all. Many thanks to all the parents and coaches who gave their time over the weekend and the last few months to prepare the athletes. Competition is open to all members of club and is encouraged for both young and old. Coaches give their time to prepare athletes and it is highly rewarding to see their voluntary effort being recognised in terms of members excelling in their chosen field. Failure is not fatal, success is never final, it is the courage to continue that counts.
