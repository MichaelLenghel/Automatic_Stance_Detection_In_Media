Athletics Lusk - The National Indoor Combined Events took place on Saturday in Athlone IT. This was the first national championship of the year and Lusk AC sent its largest team to date, with 11 members taking part across the U-16, Junior, Senior and all Master competitions. Competition was very strong and medals were hard to achieve, but we were very successful in bagging four bronze medals for the team.  Congratulations to Emma Dennis, Orla Smith, Kevin Halpin and Garret Nolan on this great achievement. But the real winners of the day were the rest of Team Lusk and their supporters who were publicly acknowledged for their team spirit on the day by the organisers.  The full team was Kirsty Seaton, Kevin Halpin, Emma Dennis, Sheila Bourke, Orla Smith, Emma Jameson, Eilish Lynch, Jacqui Palmer, Lisa Donoghue, Garret Nolan, Colm McNally and coaches Aidan McKenna and Seamus Flynn. Our new Fit4Life group got off to a great start, with 36 turning out for the first training session last Tuesday.  Well done to all for taking that first step. Fit4Life is fun, easy running and is designed for complete beginners or those returning to running.  We guarantee that you will complete a 5k parkrun in less than 12 weeks. Training is on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 7pm and expert coaching and friendly encouragement is provided by our trainers.  The group also offers some informal Saturday/Sunday runs for when members feel ready to hit longer or short runs on the road. It is a fantastic way to get back into it again in a non-pressured environment - everyone fits in and has fun.  Lusk AC Fit4Life group is proving very popular in the local and wider community and has always had a great number of both men and women. Come down some evening and check us out. Training will be at Rathmore Road every Tuesday and Thursday at 7pm. Wear comfortable clothes, runners, a Hi-viz vest and bring a drink of water. Please register via our website www.Luskathleticclub.ie. The fee is €60 for the year - looking forward to seeing you!  We were thrilled to welcome Dick Hooper, Irish Olympic marathon athlete, to Lusk NS last Thursday for a talk about long-distance running. A large crowd was in attendance to hear Dick share his vast knowledge and experience on what was an enjoyable and informative evening.  The club agm took place following the talk. Nicole Hodson was elected chairperson following a very successful stint by outgoing chairman Colm McNally. Best of luck to all elected officers.  A reminder that 2019 membership fees are due for ALL members now. You are not insured to train with us unless registered. Please do so via our website www.luskathleticclub.ie. Any issues with fees - please see Nicole or Eamon McBride in confidence.  The Lusk 4 Mile Road Race takes place on Sunday March 3rd. Registration is open, with the entry fee including a t-shirt and medal this year.  Best of luck to all athletes taking part in the National Junior and U-23 competition in Athlone next Sunday. The club will also have a huge contingent of more than 50 members taking part in the Raheny 5 mile at 3pm on Sunday.  We are looking to enter a ladies and gents team in the 50th Ras na hEireann in Drogheda on Sunday February 17th at 1pm. Could you give an expression of interest to Eamon Caffrey at training so we can get it organised. The deadline for Juvenile Indoor entries has passed. Inform Aidan immediately if you intend to enter.  Olivier Ansaldi took part in the Ballyhoura Midnight Marathon on Friday. Unfortunately, following some steep uphill sections, injury forced Olivier to withdraw at the half-way mark, but well done for giving it his best shot.  Lusk AC members were present at six different parkruns, with most travelling the short distance to Donabate where Francis McCullagh and Gavin Fogg both set new PBs. Arguably the most excitement came at Malahide where Stephen Murtagh placed third of 517 participants and Nicole Hodson celebrated her 50th run with a PB. There were also PBs for Olivia Sampson-Giles, Helen Whearity and Elizabeth Kavanagh. Well done to everyone who ran and thanks to all those who volunteered.

Could anybody with Perpetual Player of the Year trophies please return them to the bar before the big night.  Annual Membership is now due. The club have introduced two new methods of payment. One is an App for SmartPhones called Myclubfinance and can be found on Android and Apple App stores. When you open the App look for Fingallians in the Club search. Also, it's a great way to play the club lotto online as you can play the same numbers for a given amount of weeks. The other method is in the desktop. Log on to https://clubforce.com and follow the same process as the App. We are trying to get members to pay online more so than the bar it is a quicker and easier way to pay your membership.

This is part of an initiative that Fingal County Council are heading up to be more eco-friendly and also has a cash prize for the club. We also plan to introduce clean-up days of our Fingal County Council pitches on a regular basis. We ask that players start using reusable water bottles and not the single-use ones and also be aware of litter on our pitches. We are actually liable for litter on the pitches.  Academy: The Joe Duffy Group Fingallians Academy continues on Saturdays at 10am on the all-weather.

Gormanston Hurling Tournament: Best of luck to the Fingallians hurling and camogie teams who are starting their six-week stint in the Annual Gormanston indoor Hurling/Camogie competition.

Adult football: Fergal O'Hanrahan has taken charge of the third adult team and is looking for players, so If you want to return to playing football or want to take it up the place to be is the club all-weather on Tuesday at 9pm for training. The hardest thing is taking the big step back - it's easier after that! There was a great turnout for the first session, with a lot of old faces returning.  Minor football: There was a super novel way of team-bonding from the Minor team on Saturday last. They tried out some of the ups and downs of army life on the Curragh in County Kildare. We would imagine they they slept well that night!  Pitches: All Council pitches are now back. Please note any challenge matches that are taking place please, contact David McKitterick to book a pitch and contact relevant boards for permission. No permission no insurance. Also, can mentors keep an eye on the container so that things are put back where they should go.  Kit room cages: The U-14 girls team would like to thank the U-16 mentors and players for the cage they have passed on to them. They are also sharing it with the U-13 girls, so two happy teams.

Ladies football: The Under-14/15 ladies teams hosted the Down Under-15 county team in the club on Saturday afternoon, with two very competitive games of football played on the first day back of the Balheary pitches.
