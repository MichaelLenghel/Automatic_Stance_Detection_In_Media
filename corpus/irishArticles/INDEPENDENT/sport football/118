Tony McCoy was on Saturday night crowned the 2013 RTE Sports Person of the Year. The 18-times champion jockey created further history in November when he rode his 4,000th winner over jumps. McCoy fended off challenges from 11 other leading Irish contenders, including Rob Heffernan, Martyn Irvine, Tony Kelly, Michael Darragh Macauley, Michael McKillop, Annalise Murphy, Joseph O’Brien, Jason Quigley, Jonathan Sexton and Jason Smyth to lift the prize. He said: "It's great, it's a fantastic honour. Any one of them would be a very worthy winner." Clare’s hurlers received the RTÉ Sports Team of the Year award as a result of a public vote and manager Davy Fitzgerald landed the RTÉ Sports Manager of the Year award after guiding his young charges to victory in the All-Ireland SFC final replay against Cork. Fitzgerald has been instrumental in three of the Banner County’s four All-Ireland triumphs, having won titles as a player in 1995 and 1997. Former Republic of Ireland international Paul McGrath was inducted into the RTÉ Sports Awards Hall of Fame. The cultured defender, who enjoyed long stints with both Manchester United and Aston Villa, cited the 1990 World Cup as a career highlight during his acceptance speech. Online Editors
