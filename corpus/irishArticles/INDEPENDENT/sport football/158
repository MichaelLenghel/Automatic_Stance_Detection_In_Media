St Killian's AC  It was a super couple of days for St Killian's athletes young and old who were competing in numerous different competitions. Pride of place has to go to Jack Forde, who showed great resilience, dedication and focus to take gold in the national under-13 high jump final held in Tullamore last weekend.

Well done to Jack and the coaches in the club who worked hard to make this happen. At the Wexford senior track and field championships, Jean Dwyer had a great performance to claim second in senior high jump and second in under-18 long jump. Aoileann Hourihane took bronze in the under-18 long jump and Ann-Marie Nolan took bronze in the 3000m walk. Niall Sheil took gold in the masters' 1500m with Will Doyle and Anne Marie Nolan competing in the 1500m also. Niall Sheil travelled to Dungarvan on Friday last to compete in the 23rd annual and infamous marine climb. The six-mile race culminates in a three-mile uphill finish and is not for the faint hearted. In a competitive field Niall took the title of "king of the hill" from Brian Murphy from Carrick-on-Suir and Raivis Zakis of West Waterford AC. Jay Kehoe was in action last weekend in Waterford where he competed in the Viking half marathon.  Jay had a great race but unfortunately was sent the wrong way and ended up running 23k in 84 minutes. If he had not been misled he would have definitely finished the half in a PB time. Lastly, well done to Padraig Moriarty who competed on Sunday last in the national half-ironman triathlon. Padraig had a great race finishing in 4hrs 40mins and fourth in his category. Well done to all.
