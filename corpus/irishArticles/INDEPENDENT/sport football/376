It was all part of a national study by Setanta in conjunction with the launch of their new golf channel and the announcement that they will be broadcasting 78 Premiership games from next September. According to Setanta, the survey aimed to delve into the minds of sports fans across the nation. It was conducted throughout the country last October and involved a sample of 200 people in each county. While the responses varied slightly from county to county, the results showed that sport played a very important role in the daily lives of most Irish people. So how did Sligo fare? Well, almost 45% of people in the county named soccer as their favourite sport, with 13.0% of respondents preferring Gaelic football and 9% choosing hurling. Other interesting findings showed that 71% of Sligo citizens interviewed participated in sports regularly. This included anything from playing a team sport to enjoying a round of golf or walking to work. Tiger Woods emerged as the county’s favourite golfer with 35.5% nominating him as their number one. The favourite soccer team among Sligo people is Manchester United, according to the survey. Roy Keane was a clear winner across the country as the greatest ever Irish sports star and Sligo fitted the nationwide pattern with the former Manchester United star taking 23.5% of the poll. Even though soccer featured as the most popular sport, many of the respondents clearly weren’t quite up to speed on the Premiership. For example, David Beckham came third in a poll to find the most over rated player in England, even though he hasn’t played in the Premiership for the past three seasons!!! A complete breakdown of the Sligo survey shows the following results: FAVOURITE SPORT: Soccer 45%, Gaelic football 13.0%, Hurling 9%, golf 7%, Golf 4.5%, Formula One 6%, Rugby 4.5%, Others 15% DO YOU PLAY SPORT REGULARLY: Yes 71%; No 29% FAVOURITE GOLFER: Tiger Woods 35.5%, Others 33%, Padraig Harrington 13.5%, Darren Clarke 13%, Christy O’Connor 2% FAVOURITE SOCCER TEAM: Manchester United 22%, Liverpool 18%, Celtic 15.5%, Don’t have one 15.5%, Sligo Rovers 11.5%, Arsenal 5.5%, Ireland 5%, Other 4%, Chelsea 3% GREATEST EVER IRISH SPORTS STAR: Roy Keane 23.5%, Sonia O’Sullivan 14%, George Best 9%, Brian O’Driscoll 6%, Stephen Roche 5%, Damien Duff 3.5%, Ken Doherty 3%, Michelle Smith 3%, Robbie Keane 3%, Wayne McCullagh 3%, Others 21.5% THE MOST OVER RATED PLAYER IN THE PREMIERSHIP: Rio Ferdinand 12.5%, Ashley Cole 11%, David Beckham 9.5%, Wayne Rooney 6%, Frank Lampard 6%, Ronaldo 5%, Robbie Fowler 3.5%, Others 21.5% WHAT TEAM WOULD YOU NEVER CHEER FOR: Chelsea 15.5%, Manchester United 13%, Dublin 11%, England 7.5%, Liverpool 6%, Cork 5%, Kerry 2.5%, Arsenal 2%, Mayo 1.5%, Others 35.5% FANS OF WHICH TEAM BRAG THE MOST: Dublin 54.5%, Cork 7.5%, Mayo 5%, Sligo Rovers 4.5%, Galway 4%, Offaly 1.5%, Others 15% FAVOURITE IRISH SPORTING MOMENT OF ALL TIME: World Cup 1990 28.5%; Tripe Crown win for Ireland 22%, Ryder Cup 2006 3.5%, Sonia O’Sullivan at Olympics 3.5%, Ireland v Germany World Cup 2002 3%, Ken Doherty World Title 3%, Michelle Smith at Olympics 2.5%, Christy O’Connor, Ryder Cup 1999 2%, Stephen Roche Tour De France 1987 2%, Ray Houghton’s goal against Italy in 2004 World Cup 1.5%, Michael Carruth Olympic Gold Medal 1.5%, Other 23.5% WILL ROY KEANE BE A SUCCESS AT SUNDERLAND: Yes 70.5%; No 18%.

Most surveys can be taken with a pinch of salt — this one with the whole box, I think. —————————————————————— With Irish rugby on the crest of a wave at the moment, Brendan Fanning’s ‘From There To Here” should make fascinating reading for followers of the game. Fanning notes that no country was more opposed to the introduction of professionalism in Rugby Union in 1995 than Ireland. Yet the game has gone from strength to strength in this country in the professional era, producing a number of World class players, and many memorable triumphs. The author says the game has never been more popular or more successful but claims that much of its management structure is stuck in the amateur era. ‘From There to Here’ charts Ireland’s progress since the professional era began and assesses where Ireland can go from here ————————————————————- Last week’s question asked who David O’Leary replaced as a substitute in the famous Ireland v Romania match at the 1990 World Cup before going on to covert the decisive penalty in a dramatic shoot out. The answer: Steve Staunton. Now for this week’s question. After all the buzz surrounding the first match under floodlights at Croke Park recently, this week’s poser asks who was the first Sligo Rovers player to score in a floodlit match at the Showgrounds?
