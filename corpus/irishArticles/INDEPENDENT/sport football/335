Corach Ramblers Congratulations to this week's split-the-pot winner Wendy Staunton - Wendy picks up a cool Ä760. The draw took place in Stafford's of Tullycanna. Thanks a million to everyone for your continued support. #COYR The A-team were at home to a good Tombrack side today in the league and had a good 2-0 win. We started brightly and after six minutes we took the lead when following a good move involving Richie, Philly and mark the ball was played wide to Adam, whose excellent cross found hermi at the back post and on his first start in 12 weeks he calmly slotted home. On 15 minutes we won a series of corners which ended with tadhg being denied his first goal by the crossbar. Tombrack were playing some good football too and got through on a couple of occasions but were denied both times by good saves from Darren. On the half hour some excellent pressure from Philly resulted in the centre half having to play back to his keeper but Hermi got there first and was taken down for a penalty which he then dispatched to the back of the net for a two goal lead. The second half saw Tombrack trying hard to get back into the game but we were defending well and on the odd occasion they did get shots away Darren was on hand to deal comfortably with them, while we were threatening on the counter but could not get the third. All in all a perfect response to our defeat last week and another important three points. New Ross Standard
