This week's jackpot stands at €5,950. Bingo continues each Monday night at 8.30, with Tom Whelan calling the numbers CuChulainn U-16s put up a spirited performance in the second half against a stronger Trinity Gaels side last Wednesday but were unfortunately beaten in the end, 1-9 to 3-16. A disappointing second-half performance saw Towers suffer a defeat to Innisfails in a game they expected to win, with a final score of 2-11 to 0-10. A depleted Towers squad, with just 16 players - including six off the Minor panel - had the majority of possession in the first half, missed penalty and at the break led by three points. However they conceded a soft goal early in the second half and were disappointing from therein. On the positive side, there were good showings from minors Dermot Leech and Kieran McKittrick. Congratulations to the Dublin Ladies Minor team who beat Cork in the All Ireland semi-final on Saturday. They now face Tyrone for the All Ireland title on 6th August. Good luck ladies. Congratulations also to the Dublin Minor and Senior teams on their victories in Croke Park on Sunday over Meath in the Leinster Finals. We wish you continued success in the Championship.

A number of task forces will be set up over the coming weeks and your full support is required. The club lotto continues to grow, with two draws for the price of one.
