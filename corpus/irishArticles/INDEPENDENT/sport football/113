The top young GAA players in the country were honoured last night at the Independent.ie HE GAA Rising Stars awards in Croke Park. The awards were presented by Uachtarán CLG Aogán O Fearghail and Ger Kevillie (Sports Editor Independent.ie) while among the recipients in attendance were Conor Moynagh and Mickey Quinn from Sigerson Champions DCU and Brian Troy and Tommy Heffernan from UL, winnners of this year's Fitzgibbon Cup. Victorious managers Niall Moyna (DCU) and Brian Lohan (UL) were also in attendance. Gerry Tully (Chairman Comhairle Ardoideachais) thanked Independent.ie for their support through the season and congratulated those selected on their performances and achievement. Uachtarán CLG Aogán O Fearghail congratulated the players selected on their achievement and acknowledged the contribution of the families and university clubs in their development: “The players are at the centre of our Association and it is important to acknowledge these young players’ achievements and performances during this year’s Independent.ie Higher Education Competitions. The support they have received from their families and team mentors will have played a big role in their careers on and off the field." Ger Keville (Sports Editor Independent.ie) said: “On behalf of Independent.ie, we are delighted to be sponsors of the Higher Education Championships. The young stars who participate are the very players who will grace the Croke Park pitch on All Ireland Final days and we are privileged to be part of that. "I congratulate all the winners of the Independent.ie Rising Stars awards as well as every one of the players who took part in the Higher Education Championships this year.” After two memorable weekends in Munster hosted by University College Cork and Limerick IT, DCU eventually came out on top after extra-time against the hosts and holders UCC in the Independent.ie Sigerson Cup final while it took a replay for UL to overcome reigning champions WIT in the Independent.ie Fitzgibbon Cup. 1.
