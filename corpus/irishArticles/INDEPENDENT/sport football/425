Little Athletics and the juvenile groups are now on an Easter holiday break. Only children preparing for competition will train tonight (Tuesday) and on Thursday 25th - only competition children. Adults will continue to train on a casual basis amongst themselves. Everyone is due back on Tuesday 30th.  Have a fantastic Easter break and good luck to all our athletes competing over this time. The North Leinster Track & Field is on May 1st and 3rd.  Students need to choose their two events - and please ensure that your college has made arrangements for you to compete on the day of your competition.   Fingallians  Senior Football Championship: Our senior footballers kicked off their Senior B Championship group games on Sunday with a game against Cuala in O'Toole Park, but unfortunately they came up short on a scoreline of 0-9 to 2-16. The second team won their opening championship game against St Brigids 2-5 to 0-6 and the thirds lost to Clann Mhuire 3-10 to 1-6. Academy: The Academy is taking a short break as it is the Easter weekend and it will be back again on April 27th.  Hurling: The management of the adult hurling teams would like to thank all those who supported their Quiz Night in the bar on Friday last. Senior Championship game: A great evening was had in Lawless Park on Friday night, with the club hosting St Vincent's and St Brigids in their Senior Championship game. Well done to all those who helped out on the night and showed the club and its facilities at their best.

Hurling Feile:  Well done to the U-14 boys and their mentors who took part in the Feile on Saturday in the club. They narrowly missed out on a semi-final place. Many thanks to all those who helped with the day and for all the support for the team.  Minor hurling: There was a super display by the Minor hurlers in Balheary on Sunday, beating close rivals Naomh Mearnog. That's two weeks in a row now beating Naomh Mearnog as they took the honours the week previously in football.  Dublin U-16 camogie: Well done to our own Niamh Crowley who helped the Dublin U-16 camogie team to beat Wexford in the U-16A Championship. They now go on to face Kilkenny in the Leinster final.

Numbers drawn in last Tuesday's lotto were 17, 22, 34, 35 and there was no winner of the jackpot, which stands at a whopping €3,940 for tonight's draw.   O'Dwyer's We had a very historic weekend here in O'Dwyer's hosting the U-14 Feile na nGael, expertly organised as always by Denise and the coaching and games committee.   Our hurlers put on a fine display of skill and stamina which saw them progress into the final, which was a first for O'Dwyer's. The final took place on Sunday morning in Tallaght and the support this team were given was testament to our club family. It wasn't to be on the day for the lads, but we could not be more proud of the players, coaches, parents and supporters. There are big things ahead for this group of players!   Congratulations to Fingal Gaels on their Feile na nGael Division 7 title. Thank you also to Parnells, Ballyboden St Endas, Ballinteer St Johns and St Vincents who travelled to Bremore Park on Saturday. The Senior ladies play Skerries Harps on Wednesday in Bremore Park at 7pm - all support welcome.

There was super football by both teams and both are chasing silverware.    Development update: Work is really moving along now on our all-weather pitch, with 450mm of stone currently being laid for drainage. All are on target for a summer opening.  Finance wise, however, the club is not out of the woods yet. We still need more support to ensure the project is finished, with floodlighting and proper landscaping. If you haven't come on board yet to donate, please get in touch now and join the 250 people who've given to date. To make it even easier, we have set up an online donation page, but contacting a club committee member is still the easiest way to help.  See www.maurs.ie for the details. This project is the future of the club. It guarantees winter training at home, no matches called off or moved away, a home for school teams and the best club facilities in north Dublin.  The U-14 boys would like to thank everyone who helped out at the fRos-Lusca Fèile Na Gael. Even though the results didn't all go our way it was a great day and the boys seemed to really bond and enjoy the occasion. This team are only together now for three months and only had three competitive games under their belt, and to have a Fèile to begin with was very challenging. However they did really well and did their clubs, parents, mentors and parishes proud.   The atmosphere in the club was fantastic and a credit to all who supported the event. Special thanks to Tom Larkin, our team physio for the day, our venue coordinator Maurice and all the other volunteers. There was lots of food left over, and with the help of Eoin Boyle and his Garda colleagues it went into the homeless at the GPO.   Academy hurls are ready to go. Each registered Academy child can now practise small ball at home. Most games are won when no one is watching! We will also distribute the complementary hurl, training top and wristband for registered academy players. Hard luck to our hurlers who were defeated on what was an historic first appearance in the Intermediate Championship away to Clontarf.  In an exciting match Maur's were made rue a series of missed scoring opportunities and despite their best efforts after half-time were unable to close the gap, losing by six points. In the Junior D Hurling Championship Group 2 the same weekend our game finished St Patrick's (D) 2-11 St Maur's 0-17.  Our Under 14 girls hosted the same team from Barrógs in camogie and football, played very well and came out on top in both codes.  Easter Camp 2019 registrations are now open!
