CELEBRATING the great and the good of Irish sport, a host of the country's top footballers, jockeys, boxers, athletes and folders turned out for the annual Irish Independent Sports Awards today. The star-studded event, held at the Westbury Hotel in Dublin and saw a string of famous faces attend. MC'd by Sky Sports presenter Rachel Wyse, there were three prizes handed out during the three-course meal. Horse trainer Jim Bolger was initiated into the Hall of Fame, following in the footsteps of Jimmy Magee, Jack Charlton and John Giles, while champion jockey AP McCoy was crowned the Sports Star of the Year and Clare hurler Tony Kelly took home the Young Sports Star of the Year accolade. Tony attended the event with his All-Ireland winning team mates, Shane O'Donnell and Podge Collins, and during his acceptance speech it was noted that manager Davy Fitzgerald had called and expects them back at training this evening. Although they were not receiving any award, the Republic of Ireland's 'dream team' management partnership Roy Keane and Martin O'Neill drew plenty of attention when they arrived with the FAI's John Delaney. Other guests included Fionnuala Britton, Michael Carruth, Packie Bonnar and Martin Irvine. Flat jockey Joseph O'Brien arrived with his dad Aidan, while two-time Major winning golfer Padrag Harrington was accompanied by his mother Breda. Before the awards, Padraig received special recognition for winning the Irish Independent's Sports Star of the Year three times throughout its 25 years running. Online Editors
