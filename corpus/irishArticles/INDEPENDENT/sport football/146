Sports clubs the length and breadth of Fingal are celebrating this week after the announcement of a bumper year for Sports Capital Grants from the Government, after the fund was almost doubled this year. Some 48 Fingal clubs collected over €3.7 million from this pre-Christmas bonanza funding everything from pitch development to floodlighting projects and clubhouse developments. Announcing the €56 million national fund, Minister Shane Ross said: 'This is a great day for Irish sport. When we originally invited applications under the scheme, we had just €30m to allocate and the record level of applications would have left a large number of good projects unsupported and many clubs disappointed. 'Happily, following the conclusion of budget discussions, I was delighted to secure the required additional resources to enable me to allocate €56m in total to local sports clubs and organisations throughout the country. The net result of this is that we are able to provide financial assistance towards over 1,700 different projects all over the country.' Reacting to the Fingal allocation from the grants, Senator James Reilly welcomed the funding and said: 'As a former Minister who set up the national programme, Health Ireland, I am delighted that the Fine Gael Government continue to invest in sporting facilities for Fingal.' He called on future funding from the Sports Capital Grants programme for a planned 'sports hub' in Donabate and to develop at least one municipal swimming pool to serve populations in Swords and Balbriggan. Deputy Alan Farrell TD said : 'Funding our sports clubs and organisations is vital to community life and to increasing involvement at local level in sports and physical activity. This is of particular importance as we work to tackle obesity, especially amongst children. I wish to extend my congratulations to all of the successful clubs in Dublin Fingal for the hard-work both in our local communities, and in delivering this level of funding for their organisation.' Deputy Louise O'Reilly TD also welcomed the funding, saying: 'It is fantastic to see the number of clubs who will receive much needed funding for facilities, equipment, pitches, courts, and gyms amongst other things. All of these clubs do great work at adult and juvenile level, they are often the pillar of our communities and an extended family, and this funding will help them do even more.' Cllr Darragh Butler (FF) agreed and said: 'This is welcome news and an early Christmas present for a number of Fingal and north County Dublin sports clubs.'   2017 sports grants recipients Aer Lingus Swimming Club - €7,290 for competitive swimming development programme; Balbriggan Cricket Club - €38,141 for equipment  Balbriggan Rugby Football Club - €130,000 for pitch development Ballyboughal GFC - €150,000 to develop second grass pitch and clubhouse extension Balrothery Football Club - €19,580 for new sports equipment Clann Mhuire GFC - €133,830 for pitch resurfacing with floodlights Donabate Golf Club Limited - €138,119 for golf practice area Donabate Portrane Tennis Club Ltd - €144,000 for two tennis courts and toilets Fingal County Council - €95,379 for refurbishment of dressing room/showers/toilets Kinsealy Boys - €24,045 for ball Stop net/palisade storage fence Glebe North, Balbriggan - €58,283 for replacement of an all-weather surface Balrothery Balbriggan Tennis Club - €121,260 for refurbishment of tennis courts Skerries Community Centre - €150,000 for replacement or roof Fingal Co Council - €150,000 for new Futsal/Indoor Training Hall Fingal Co Council - €150,000 for Synthetic Soccer Pitch & Running Track Fingal Ravens G.F.C. - €75,662 for newflood lights Fingallians GAA - €53,209 for site development Forrest Little Golf Club - €47,275 for development of short course on existing course.
