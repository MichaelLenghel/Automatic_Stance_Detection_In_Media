A DRAFT text of the withdrawal agreement between the UK and EU will be published within the next two weeks, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said.  At an INM-organised Brexit breakfast at Trinity College this morning, Mr Varadkar said the UK can have as close a relationship with the EU as it wants, but it can't "cherry pick". "On avoiding new trade barriers, that is where we are at the moment. As Chancellor [Angela] Merkel said, the UK can have as close a relationship with Europe as it wants to have. What it can't do is cherry pick. The EU is a set menu restaurant not an a-la-carte." The Taoiseach said the UK can't simply continue to take the benefits of the EU after Brexit. "If you're a member of the club, you're a member of the club. And if you want to be an associate member, you can't write the rules yourself. That is a circle that still needs to be squared." Mr Varadkar said the text of the withdrawal agreement will be published within two weeks.

That will be very interesting and will certainly crystallise things." Mr Varadkar said Ireland also needs to build new alliances in Europe ahead of the UK's EU departure. He said the UK as a member slowed down European integration.

"We are losing a friend in that regard, also a friend in terms of tax sovereignty and countries being able to set their own tax rules."

Niall FitzGerald, the former boss of global consumer goods company Unilever, said we have a responsibility to speak out on Brexit. He said he has spoken publicly about the UK's openness. "But now Brexit is already happening, the UK is losing business, investment and talent. It has created a climate of uncertainty and unease that won't easily be reversed. It is impacting Ireland in key sectors, namely food and tourism. We must not stand idly by. Ireland is the ideal choice for many UK firms. We should no longer be diffident because of a misguided loyalty to the UK government. They have not seen Ireland as their first priority." He said the Irish Government needs to take an "aspirational and forceful" national strategy, that has a focus on boosting infrastructure. He said the UK has achieved zero in its negotiations with the EU. But he said it would be wrong to think the UK electorate would change its mind. "This may change, particularly confronted with the true horror of a hard Brexit. But for now, the working assumption must be that Brexit is inevitable," he said. He said business needs to "debunk" the idea of a global Britain outside of the EU. Mr FitzGerald said we need to help those politicians working to avoid Brexit. He also said that he was concerned that services could become an "afterthought" in the Brexit negotiations, as the UK focuses on financial services. "I am increasingly concerned about contagion to the wider services sector, " Mr FitzGerald said. "We could end up saving trade, at the expense of services. Both the UK and Ireland are service based economies. An open market for services is at least as important as trade. "As the Brexit saga moves from miscalculation to farce and on to catastrophe, let's remind ourselves what else Ireland will lose. It will lose its closest ally and staunchest friend on many issues in Brussels. Britain has stoutly defended the right of individual countries to set their own tax regime." Mr FitzGerald said Ireland's relationship will be changed within the EU, signalling there will be a greater integrationist push. He said we will only realise how much we will miss the UK's, once it has left. "See this as a gypsy's warning," he said. The Brexit Breakfast was sponsored by Allianz.
