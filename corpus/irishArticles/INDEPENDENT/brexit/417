Brexit would be reversed if the referendum on EU membership was held again, according to a new poll. Some 51.2pc would vote to Remain and 48.8pc opt to Leave, the research for the Daily Mirror suggests. The survey suggests the regret some Brexiteers felt immediately after the poll result had not dissipated as 13.5pc of those who chose to leave said they would now vote to stay in the union, while just 9.3pc of "In" voters would change their mind. But the Google survey of more than 44,000 readers of Mirror websites showed 51.3pc were not in favour of a second referendum. The majority (52.6pc) ranked control of immigration above staying in the single market but 25.8pc said they felt less positive about the country's future following Theresa May's speech on her Brexit strategy. The poll, which included readers in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, also found 54.7pc feared the UK would split within the next decade. Labour MP Pat McFadden, who backs the Open Britain campaign, told the paper the result should be a "warning" to the Prime Minister not to neglect the views of those who voted Remain. But Change Britain spokeswoman Chloe Westley said other polls had shown "strong" support for Brexit. :: The Google Survey received 44,681 responses, with 35,020 from England, 4,322 in Scotland, 1,911 from Wales and 1,164 from Northern Ireland.
