Rob Stothard/PA Wire PA / The Leave camp led the contest in Wales right from the off - claiming the first 10 councils. Among the early victories for Leave were Wales's second city Swansea as well as several traditionally Labour areas including Newport, Caerphilly and Merthyr Tydfil. Turnouts in Wales have also been a lot higher than in UK and Welsh Assembly elections - with Monmouthshire topping 76.2%. The result is in stark contrast to Wales's Celtic cousins in Northern Ireland and Scotland - where there was strong support for the Remain campaign.

"I'm also pleased that Wales is the only nation so far to vote to leave the EU. "I think people from an early stage people have shown their concern about the EU and the way it was encroaching on their everyday lives." Read more here:  PA Media
