From the moment David Cameron promised a referendum, through tense negotiations, many resignations, and a controversial prorogation, here is a timeline of the key moments in the process of the UK's exit from the European Union so far. - January 23 2013 Under intense pressure from many of his own MPs and with the rise of Ukip, Prime Minister David Cameron promises an in-out referendum on EU membership if the Conservatives win the 2015 general election. Mr Cameron pledges to campaign with "all my heart and soul" for Britain to vote to Remain in the referendum, which he said would be by the end of 2017. - May 7 2015 The Tories unexpectedly make sweeping gains over Ed Miliband's Labour Party and secure a majority in the Commons. Mr Cameron vows to deliver his manifesto pledge for an EU referendum. - June 23 2016 The UK votes to leave the EU in a shock result that saw 52% of the public support Brexit in a humiliating defeat for the Prime Minister. Mr Cameron quickly resigns, saying: "I don't think it would be right for me to try to be the captain that steers our country to its next destination."  


 - July 13 2016 Theresa May takes over as Prime Minister after a bitter selection battle in which she triumphed over rivals including Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and Andrea Leadsom. Mrs May, who had backed Remain, promises to "rise to the challenge" of negotiating the UK's exit.  


 - November 10 2016 The High Court rules against the Government and says Parliament must hold a vote to trigger Article 50, the mechanism that begins the exit from the EU. Mrs May says the ruling would not stop her from invoking the legislation by April 2017. - March 29 2017 Mrs May triggers Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. European Council president Donald Tusk said that the triggering of Article 50 was not a happy occasion, telling a Brussels press conference his message to the UK was: "We already miss you. Thankyou and goodbye." - April 18 2017 Mrs May announces a snap general election to be held on June 8. Justifying the decision, she said: "The country is coming together but Westminster is not." The Prime Minister said "division in Westminster will risk our ability to make a success of Brexit". - June 8 & June 9 2017 A general election takes place in the UK, which results in a hung parliament. Mrs May becomes head of a minority Conservative government - propped up by the Democratic Unionists - after her general election gamble backfired disastrously.

But it is understood that all members of the Cabinet have signed up to the proposals and none of them have decided to quit rather than back the plan.

She said she had a "renewed mission - delivering the Brexit people voted for, bringing the country back together and building a country that really works for everyone". - January 15 2019 MPs reject Mrs May's Brexit plans by an emphatic 432 votes to 202 in a historic vote which throws the future of her administration and the nature of the UK's EU withdrawal into doubt.
