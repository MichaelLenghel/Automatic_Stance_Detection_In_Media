A EWE that is aborting is possibly the most worrying sight that faces a shepherd. Will it be a once-off? Or is it the start of an abortion storm? Ewes can abort for a multitude of reasons and it is normal for a flock to have a small proportion of abortions every year. However, if the abortion rate exceeds 2pc then it's time to start worrying. But should you wait until you hit 2pc before you act? The answer is certainly no. Treat every ewe that aborts as the potential start of an abortion storm. Take steps immediately to identify the cause and contain any potential spread of infection. When a ewe aborts, you should immediately remove her from the flock and keep her in isolation. Contact you vet and arrange to have the aborted foetus and afterbirth sent to your local veterinary laboratory for examination. Take extreme precautions that you or members of your family are not exposed to potential infection as some agents that cause abortion in sheep also affect humans. Continue to submit any further sample of aborted material to the laboratory, even if you are getting negative results. It can take a number of foetuses before something will show up. Do not reintroduce ewes that aborted to the rest of the flock or even ewe lambs until you have definitive cause for the abortion.
