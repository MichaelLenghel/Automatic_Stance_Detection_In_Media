HEALTH Minister Leo Varadkar knew of the medical dilemma surrounding a young pregnant woman deemed to be brain dead before he made a Dail speech on abortion. Tanaiste Joan Burton today today told the Dail that she learned about the case when she was phoned last Sunday by the Health Minister. Mr Varadkar made a speech on Tuesday night calling for changes to the Constitution, the law and medical practice to deal with difficult pregnancies. He said he did not want a liberal abortion regime but law and practice must take more account of the mother's health in the medium and long term, and not just the unborn baby's and mother's life. The Minister would not say yesterday if he was aware of the latest case, involving a young woman deemed dead from brain trauma and 17 weeks pregnant in a hospital outside Dublin, when he spoke in the Dail on Tuesday. The comments caused disquiet among Fine Gael TDs and Senators and the Taoiseach distanced himself from the matter saying there would no rush to change the Constitution or law until the 2013 Protection of Life in Pregnancy Act was given time to be applied. The Tanaiste today expressed her sincere sympathy with the family and said she would not comment on the case which may soon be before the courts. Mr Burton appealed to everyone to discuss the issue respectfully and calmly and avoid taking extreme positions. Earlier, Labour deputy leader Alan Kelly confirmed that the party will not seek another abortion referendum in the lifetime of this government. Online Editors
