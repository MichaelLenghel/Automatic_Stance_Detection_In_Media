SIX Cork women a week travel to the UK for an abortion, The Corkman can reveal. Information released to this newspaper by the UK Dept of Health shows that 1,304 women with addresses in Co Cork obtained abortions in England and Wales between 2008 and 2011. The disclosure comes as TDs this week continue to debate the contents of the expert group's report on abortion. Statistics disclosed to The Corkman also includes the numbers by age and marital status of the Cork women. We also learned that over 98% of Cork women had an abortion to prevent 'injury to the physical or mental health' of the mother. MORE than six Cork women a week travel to the UK for an abortion, The Corkman can reveal. The disclosure comes as TDs this week continue to debate the contents of the expert group's report on abortion and the European Court of Human Rights judgment. Information released to this newspaper by the British Department of Health have shown that 1,304 women providing addresses in Co. Cork presented at abortion clinics across England and Wales in the four years between 2008 and 2011 inclusive. A total of 17,574 women with Irish addresses sought abortions in the UK during that time, and the county address of 2,309 of these women is unknown - opening up the possibility that more women from Cork travelled for the procedure than the 1,304 on record. The figures reveal that: Just over 70% of the abortions were carried out in the first nine weeks of pregnancy. 78% of the women seeking an abortion were single and almost 19% were married, divorced, widowed or separated. 18% of terminations were provided to women who had one or more previous abortions. Over 62% of the procedures involved women aged 25 or older. Almost 95% of abortions were carried out via surgical procedure. Last month, The Corkman applied for data relating to legal abortions provided by UK Department of Health for women who gave a home address within the County of Cork from 2007 to 2011. Furthermore, this newspaper asked for the information to be broken down by the age, number of previous abortions, gestation weeks, the type of procedure provided and the marital status of those seeking an abortion. Data collected for 2007 did not include county address, and so the figures supplied for Cork relate only to 2008 to 2011 inclusive. The Department of Health was unable to provide a breakdown based on where in the UK Cork women presented for abortions.
