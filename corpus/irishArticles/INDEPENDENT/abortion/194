THE new abortion bill will not lead to abortion on demand, Taoiseach Enda Kenny has told the Dail. Mr Kenny said there is "no question or intent in any circumstances for an opening of abortion on demand". The Taoiseach agreed with Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams that such suggestions were disrespectful to women, adding: "This is a compassionate country." He again said it is the Government's intention to have the bill passed by the Dail summer recess. Independent TD Clare Daly told Mr Kenny the bill doesn't go far enough, and will ensure women continue travelling to the UK for abortions, but the Taoiseach said the new legislation is about saving women's lives. Separately, Mr Kenny's Fine Gael constituency colleague, anti-abortion TD Michelle Mulherin, said the bill "might very well be unworkable and unconstitutional". But when asked on 'Newstalk' radio if she will vote against the Government, she said: "I'm not rushing anywhere." Fine Gael Galway senator Fidelma Healy-Eames said she would find it difficult to support the bill as it stands. Ms Healy-Eames said she will work to make changes to the bill, although Mr Kenny says there will be no changes. It comes ahead of meetings of the Fine Gael and Labour parliamentary parties this afternoon and evening, which are expected to be dominated by abortion.   The Fine Gael meeting, in particular, is expected to be stormy.
