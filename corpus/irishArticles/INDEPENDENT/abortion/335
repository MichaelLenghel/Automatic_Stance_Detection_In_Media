THE MESSAGE from Louth and indeed the remainder of the country in the Referenda on abortion held in November, 1992 was that information should be made available on abortion and that women should be allowed travel to have an abortion, but abortion should never be allowed in Ireland. The Referendum was held in conjunction with the General Election in 1992 and Louth voted that the Constitution should be amended so that information should be made available on abortion within the country and that women should be free to travel outside of the country to seek an abortion. But the abortion amendment, distinguishing between the life and health of the mother was defeated by the heavy majority of almost two to one. The turnout for the election and the three questions posed in the referenda was 67.3%, and the surprise to many was that there were only a small number of spoiled votes, 500, despite the electorate having to deal with a general election ballot paper and three different questions on the abortion referenda. The voting in the abortion referendum (Right to Life) was 61.2% against changing the amendment to allow abortion and 38.8% for. On the right to travel to have an abortion, 59.4 % were in favour with 40.6% against while 57.7% were in favour of information on abortion being supplied to people while Louth42.8% thought that no information should be made available on abortion. The figures in Louth were much in line with the national average.
