Women from Northern Ireland who want to have a medical abortion in the Republic will have to pay the €450 fee. The service is free to women in the Republic but this is not being extended. The Irish Family Planning Association (IFPA) in Dublin, which provides abortion up to nine weeks, would charge €150 for the first appointment, and a combined fee of €300 for the second and third appointments. This is based on the Department of Health fee structure for abortion care. More than 900 women from Northern Ireland travelled to England for an abortion in 2017. The number was an increase of more than 25pc on the year before and the highest level since 2011. The law is much stricter in Northern Ireland than in the rest of the UK. It is permitted only if a woman's life is at risk, or there is a permanent or serious risk to her mental or physical health. Free Fatal foetal abnormalities, rape and incest are not circumstances in which abortions can be performed legally. In June 2017, the UK government announced women from Northern Ireland will be able to have free abortions in England. There has been an increase in the number of women from the North to have a termination in England and Wales since the funding announcement. Nine out of 10 abortions were carried out under 13 weeks. The highest abortion rate is among women aged 20-24. Some 98pc of abortions were funded by the NHS, which has been the same level since 2013, but an increase from 88pc in 2007. Irish Independent
