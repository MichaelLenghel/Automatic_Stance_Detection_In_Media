THE HSE is going to conduct an internal inquiry into its handling of the case of the woman who had a baby delivered by Caesarean section after seeking an abortion. HSE director general Tony O’Brien is commissioning a report to establish the full facts of the case, the care the woman received, the operation of the abortion legislation. The HSE claims it wants to end any inaccurate commentary around the matter. The HSE has released a statement this evening: "The Director General of the Health Service Executive has requested that a Report be completed for him that establishes all of the facts surrounding the care given to a woman who had her pregnancy ended pursuant to the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013. "Through the Report the Director General will seek to establish the full facts surrounding the matter, the sequence of events, the care given to the woman involved, the operation of the 2013 Act and any learnings that can be gleaned from the case. It is hoped that the Report will end any inaccurate commentary surrounding this matter currently. "As they had a specific Statutory function as detailed in the 2013 Act, this Report will not seek to review the decision taken by the clinicians involved in the case. "The Report is expected to be completed by the end of September. Subject to privacy restrictions, the report will be published by the HSE." More to follow. Online Editors
