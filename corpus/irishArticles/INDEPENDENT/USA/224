25-year-old Miss Connecticut Erin Brady won the crown at the celebrity filled event in Las Vegas last night. The Miss USA pageant may have its feminist critics, but the newly crowned queen landed her title after the judges were blown away by her response to a political question. Miss Brady was asked about the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to upholding widespread DNA tests, a move which she agreed with and clinch the crown for her at last night's pageant in Planet Hollywood, Las Vegas. And while Erin wowed the panel with her political know-how, it was Miss Utah Marissa Powell who has become an overnight internet sensation after fumbling her answer in relation to a question from reality star and actress NeNe Leakes, who asked what it says about society that men still make more money than women, given that women are the main breadwinners in 40 percent of American households with children. A stunned Miss Utah fumbled over her answer, saying: "We need to try to figure out how to create education better so that we can solve this problem.” As part of  the Miss USA prize, Miss Brady will be given the keys to her own apartment in New York for one year - unsurprisingly in Trump Tower, as 'The Donald' owns the Miss Universe franchise. She is expected to spend the next year raising awareness for breast and ovarian cancer, which is the official charity of the pageant; in addition to competing in Miss Universe later this year. Hosts Nick Jonas of the Jonas Brother and E!'s Giuliana Rancic led the celebrity presence at the event, which saw quirky fashion designer Betsey Johnson, former Miss Alabama Katherine Webb, Calvin Harris, and Christina Milian.
