JACK NICKLAUS will go into the final round of this year's Senior British Open with a great chance to win this  prestigious title at the first time of asking. Yesterday, the 'Golden Bear' proved he is far from being a spent force, carding a 70 to leave him on one-under-par for the championship. He trails Ian Stanley by three shots after the Australian also shot 70. Nicklaus was in excellent form as he chased what would be his first title on British soil since the 1978 Open at St Andrews. He opened with a birdie at Royal County Down's treacherous 502-yard first hole, dropped shots at both the second and the third but then bounced back with three birdies in the next five holes. The American legend, who has won a record 18 major titles, as well as almost 100 other titles around the world, went out in one-under-par 35. He then recorded a further birdie on the 479-yard par-five 12th, before carding a bogey on 17. The five home players who made the cut failed to spark yesterday, with Eddie Polland best placed on six-over-par. Cork's Denis O'Sullivan was one-under after 12 holes of his third round but drifted to a three-over-par 74, and a nine-over aggregate. Former Walker Cup player Arthur Pierse, an amateur from Tipperary, posted a three-birdie 75 for a 12-over total. Polland was the best performer, posting a four-birdie one-under-par 70 to move a little closer to the big money. "I played well in this third round. Pity about a poor start to the tournament," said Polland.
