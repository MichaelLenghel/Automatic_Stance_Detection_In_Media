USA Gymnastics has confirmed that its entire board of directors will resign as requested by the US Olympic Committee (USOC) in the wake of the Larry Nassar sexual abuse scandal.  The former USA Gymnastics sports doctor has been sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison for molesting girls and young women.  Some of the nation’s top gymnasts, including Olympians Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney, Simone Biles and Jordyn Wieber, said they were among his victims.

A handful of board members had stepped down, but the USOC said a wholesale change was needed. The USOC has also demanded much tighter reporting from USA Gymnastics on reforms it is making.  It also required all USA Gymnastics staff and board members to complete various safety and ethics training courses over the next six months. PA Media
