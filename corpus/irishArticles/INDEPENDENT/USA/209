The heat was turned up on the biggest fight in UFC history at an explosive weigh-in at Las Vegas. Before the festivities even began, Conor McGregor and Urijah Faber, a team mate of Chad Mendes, got up close and personal backstage at the MGM Grand.

When McGregor eventually got on the stage, he brought the house down and tipped the scales at 145lbs. "Chad is an overblown midget. Tomorrow I'm going to come and raise gold for Ireland, for my country," he said. Expect fireworks when the interim UFC featherweight title is decided later tonight. Online Editors
