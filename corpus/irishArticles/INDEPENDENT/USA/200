Kanye West is reportedly keen to get his mitts on the late Michael Jackson’s Neverland Ranch in a romantic gesture for his wife Kim Kardashian. The rapper was a huge fan of the Thriller musician, and is believed to be interested in the Californian property which has returned to the market for €92m. Kanye is said to be bargaining for a good price on the 2,700sq ft estate which boasts a Normandy-style main house and an estimated 22 structures on its grounds. Neverland also features two lakes, a swimming pool, a basketball court, and a tennis court. A source told The Daily Star: “Kanye is desperate to own Neverland but he’s not prepared to pay the price they want.” Despite their eagerness to move into Michael Jackson’s former abode, the pair might have to put up with the ghost of the late star rumoured to roam the grounds.

Many of the workers around the property have seen him, and they talk about him living there. It does spook many of them out.” The Thriller musician bought the estate in 1987 for $19.5m (€17.75m) and rechristened it ‘Neverland’. He extensively renovated the mansion and its grounds, developing a carnival, a working steam train and a 50 seat cinema. The estate also housed many exotic animals including chimpanzees and elephants. A source from a Californian estate agent told The Daily Star: “Local people say that Jackson’s spirit has been haunting his estate and favourite hangouts since he died. “Investors and visitors considered buying the property are warned that workers on the ranch have claimed the King of Pop haunts the premises.” Online Editors
