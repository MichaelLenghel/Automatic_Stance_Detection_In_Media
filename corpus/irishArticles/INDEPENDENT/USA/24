BRITISH OPEN EXTRA SERGIO GARCIA yesterday became golf's biggest name-dropper.The 19-year-old golfing sensation played his final practice round before The Open starts today under the watchful eye of his mentor Seve Ballesteros. And then he made an impassioned plea for the world to stop calling him Garcia. ``If you don't mind, I'd like you to call me Sergio,'' he implored in the same courteous manner which has endeared him to grannies and golf fans alike since he turned professional two months ago. ``It feels much better than Garcia and that's what I want everyone to call me. If you could write `Sergio' instead of `Garcia' it will be perfect.'' Baker-Finch return FORMER champion Ian Baker-Finch is hoping to make an emotional Open comeback next year at St Andrews. The 38-year-old Australian, who won the 1991 championship at Royal Birkdale, quit tournament golf 18 months ago after watching his game fall apart in humiliating fashion. He has since limited himself to social golf with friends but made a surprise return to action at Carnoustie on Monday, receiving special permission to play the course late in the afternoon. And now Baker-Finch, who works as a writer and commentator for American network ABC, is planning on competing again in the Millennium Open over the Old Course at St Andrews in 2000. New dad Mickelson US Open runner-up Phil Mickelson will be able to give this week's Open his full attention after celebrating the birth of his first child. The 29-year-old Ryder Cup player spent all week at Pinehurst on tenterhooks last month as wife Amy was expected to go into labour any day. He carried an electronic beeper on him at all times and insisted he was prepared to leave the course at a moment's notice if Amy went into labour even if he was leading by five shots at the time. Fortunately for the tall left-hander the call never came and he was able to finish the championship, eventually being edged out by compatriot Payne Stewart by one stroke on the final hole. Stewart's winning putt from 20 feet on Sunday night spared Mickelson an 18-hole play-off the following day and, with perfect timing, baby Amanda Brynn then arrived on Monday. Woosnam's incentive IAN WOOSNAM, winner of the US Masters in 1991, would love nothing better than to win another Major. But as he prepares for the Open at Carnoustie, he admits that recent form has made him pessimistic about his chances of mounting a challenge on the east coast of Scotland. The Welshman has been left frustrated by a broken knuckle but has now almost completely recovered. ``I'm 99% fit,'' he said. ``The injury is not really a problem any more. I am playing very poorly at the moment and this is a course where you have to hit it straight. ``The course is very tough and it could be that a total of 10 over par could win the tournament.'' Doran takes control CONOR DORAN (Banbridge), who was runner-up after a play-off for the Connacht Youths Championship last week, leads the field in the Munster Boys Amateur Open Golf Championship at Roscrea after 36 holes. Yesterday he had a two under par 69 to go with his opening 68 to lead by four shots from Paul McNamara (Youghal), the leader after the first day. The leading 50 players go forward to today's third round and the final round tomorrow.
