Here is how we rated the Boys in Green last night in their 4-1 victory over the USA. Shay Given: A solid showing from the veteran netminder who was unable to prevent Mix Diskerud's first-half strike and made two fine saves after the interval to keep Ireland ahead - 7

He showed a willingness to get forward and really grew into the game after half-time. One or two small issues defensively - 7 Alex Pearce: Earned a pat on the back from Given for two timely first-half headed interventions and put himself about throughout - although the USA did create quite a few chances - 7 Ciaran Clark: Will be unhappy he got caught under one long US ball forward in the second half where Given bailed him out but he worked hard to keep Ireland in front - 6 Robbie Brady: Some obvious defensive discomfort before the interval yet he gave his side another dimension breaking forward after the interval and set piece brilliance capped it off - 8 Stephen Quinn: He worked really hard and his pressing was a factor in some strong Irish moments after the break. A bit slow to close down a couple of US strikes from long range - 7

(Photo by Michael Steele/Getty Images) Getty Images / David Meyler: The stand-in skipper was guilty of a howler in the build-up to the American goal and that could colour the perception of a display where his mobility was a bonus. He will do better with more games under his belt - 6 Anthony Pilkington: He's a very capable player on his day and illustrated his talent with a superb finish to break the deadlock. The Cardiff winger continued to probe thereafter and can be very happy with his hour on the park - 7

 Ireland debutant David McGoldrick tussles with USA defender Geoff Cameron during their friendly at the Aviva. Photo: Barry Cregg / SPORTSFILE SPORTSFILE / Anthony Stokes: Some sympathy for the Celtic man as he is not a natural left winger and found it hard to make any impact from his station. That said, his pressure did play a part in the second goal before he was taken off - 6 

      Daryl Murphy: The in-form striker linked well with McGoldrick and can also be satisfied with how he played. But there will be lingering frustration that he's waiting for a first Irish goal after coming close twice - 7 Aiden McGeady (for Stokes, 59 mins): Gave the Americans plenty of problems during his time on the park and was warmly received - 7 James McClean (for Pilkington, 64 mins): A great option off the bench and added his fourth Irish goal - 7 Shane Long (for McGoldrick, 76 mins): Set a challenge by the man he replaced and his pace was central to late charge - 7 Jeff Hendrick (for Murphy, 76 mins): Tough night on Friday but got back on the horse with OK showing here - 6 Rob Elliot (for Given, 84 mins): Not on long enough to rate Martin O'Neill: Considering he changed his entire side, O'Neill will be extremely happy with his evening's work and the reaction from Friday. He now has some welcome selection dilemmas for the seismic tests at this location in 2015 - 7 The game at a glance David McGoldrick (Ireland): Did well on his debut. Calm and composed in setting up first two Irish goals and worked diligently throughout. Robbie Brady's nicely-taken goal in the 55th minute, and again, good work by McGoldrick with the reverse pass to set up the Hull City man to score. This was a morale-boosting win for sure but we're still a long way from making Aviva Stadium a fortress for visiting teams. Robbie Brady's stunning left foot curler over the wall from a free kick for goal number four. Pawel Raczkowski from Poland kept a firm grip on the game. Robbie Brady (Ireland goalscorer): "It was a good result for us and it was good for me to get 90 minutes under my belt. I don't usually play left wing-back so it was a good experience. Our two new boys, Cyrus and David, were excellent. David did really well for the goals." Yellow cards: Ireland 1 (Meyler, 92); USA 3 (Beckerman, 36, Altidore, 65, Cameron, 84) Red cards: Ireland 0; USA 0 Corners: Ireland 6 (2 in first half); USA 11 (7 in first half) Shots on target: Ireland 7 (2 in first half); USA 8 (4 in first half) Attendance: 33,332 What's next? Ireland will play Poland at home on March 29, 2015 in a crucial Euro 2016 qualifier. Online Editors
