TIGER WOODS, back as the world's number one golfer, said yesterday that everything felt in place for him to claim something much more precious to him his first Open title. After a week of fun and fishing in Ireland, Woods has arrived at Carnoustie in happy, confident and determined mood. And with good reason. The 23-year-old undoubtedly has the form. In his last four starts he has won three times and on the other occasion, the US Open at Pinehurst, finished in third place only two shots away from a play-off. Woods unquestionably also has the game. Defending champion Mark O'Meara, his close friend, rates him the best ball-striker he has ever seen. But the extra ingredient this year is that, unlike St Andrews, Lytham, Troon and Birkdale, Woods also has the knowledge, having played two Scottish Opens at Carnoustie in his amateur days. WOODS may be the big favourite to win the Open but he is playing the first two rounds at Carnoustie on tomorrow and Friday with two of the smallest men in the field. The world number one has been paired with Ian Woosnam, winner of the Scottish Open at the course three years ago, and Australian Craig Parry. They go out at 2.05pm in the first round. Course record holder Colin Montgomerie starts at 12.25pm with South African David Frost and American Brian Watts, who lost a play-off to Mark O'Meara at Birkdale last year. Lee Westwood is 50 minutes later and partners twice winner Greg Norman and twice US Open champion Lee Janzen. Darren Clarke is in the very next match with Paraguayan Carlos Franco, winner on the US Tour for the second time on Sunday, and 1989 Troon winner Mark Calcavecchia. Dubliner Padraig Harrington's reward for qualifying is to be paired with five-time champion Tom Watson, winner of the last Carnoustie Open in 1975, while 19-year-old Sergio Garcia partners reigning US PGA champion Vijay Singh.
