Colm Smith VALDERRAMA is not a course to trifle with. It has a reputation of being one of the toughest in Europe if not the world and when the wind blows like it did yesterday it throws up more mysteries than a good novel. The lead at the start of the third round was five under par but by the end of a warm, sunny but windy day it had been reduced to four. The man who made the most significant move was none other than Spain's own Miguel Angel Jimenez. The 35-year-old gentleman from Malaga has lived in the shadow of players like Seve Ballesteros and Jose Maria Olazabal for most of his playing career but when Seve appointed him as assistant captain for the '97 Ryder Cup on this same course, his confidence grew dramatically. He is now one of the best in Europe and one of the most respected in the world. A winner of the Volvo Masters in Montecastillo last week he stepped up again yesterday with a round of 69 to share the lead with American Chris Perry. He would dearly love to become European Number one but he is too far behind in the Volvo Ranking to aspire to such an exhalted position. That title rest between three players. Colin Montgomerie holds it, Sergio Garcia and Lee Westwood are the current pretenders to the throne that has been occupied by the Scot for a record six years in-a-row. As far as Europeans are concerned it is a far more interesting aspect of the week than the actual winning of the American Express Championship and it's $1m winner's cheque. The World Golf Championship with it's three new $5m events has not managed to excite anyone and that includes the players. The idea was great but it needs refinement and there is time for that. But at the present moment, this event the last of three, has been pretty low key and few players would agree that it should decide the final Money Lists of both the US and European Tours. The top prize can distort an entire season. For instance, Monty has won five counting events in Europe this year and is well ahead in the money stakes but if Sergio Garcia or Lee Westwood should win tomorrow, the Great Scot would have to finish second to Garcia or third to Westwood to retain his title. He is currently one over par, three behind Westwood and two behind Garcia but he can take solace in the fact that if anyone other those two should win, he will stretch his record to an astonishing seven titles in-a-row. Tiger Woods is still in with more than a shout to win his ninth tournament of the year. In fact, at three under, he lies in a group of six along with Tom Lehman, Nick Price, Hal Sutton and Justin Leonard just one shot behind the joint leaders. Darren Clarke should thank his lucky stars. Last in the field on Thursday he progressed through Friday with a splendid 66 but missed his aim yesterday. ``I set a target of level par after that disaster on Thursday. I got half-way there on Friday with 67 and today I expected to get even closer to the target. I suppose a round of level par was not too bad but I played better than that.'' He remains at four over par, eight behind the leaders with no chance of winning the event, but being a practical man he is still focused on a target of level par by the end of the tournament. ``I made two silly mistakes at ten and 11 and paid the penalty. I went bogey bogey which was like losing three shots because the 11th is a birdie chance. I was worth a round of 68 which would have been pretty good considering the windy conditions. It just means I have a lot of work to do tomorrow to reach my target.'' The fact of the matter is that Clarke is tired, physically and mentally. This is his seventh straight week in high powered events including the Ryder Cup and the Dunhill Cup and the buck does not stop here. He moves on to the Johnnie Walker Classic in Taipei next week and from there to Japan for two events before South Africa where he plays the million dollar classic and the South African Open. Clarke has won only five times in nine years as a professional. He knows, and so does the world, that it's not enough to justify his talent. Padraig Harrington shot one under par for the day but is seven over for the tournament and too far back to influence the distribution of the major cheques. He too, is feeling the mental pressure. ``There is nothing happening in my game at the moment. Things were a little better today but I am still making silly mistakes.''
