The All-Ireland football championship began on the other side of the Atlantic this evening with New York on the receiving end of a heavy beating. Who lifts Sam Maguire will be decided over the next 20 weeks and began tonight with the most easily predicted game of the lot as Galway strolled to a 2-18 to 0-8 victory over New York at the Gaelic Grounds.

Picture credit: Ray Ryan / SPORTSFILE SPORTSFILE / New York got to within seven points of the Tribesmen in 2010 and trailed by just two with 20 minutes remaining in that game but there was no repeat of those heroics. Galway led by 0-9 to 0-4 at the interval and put some daylight between the sides in the second half with goals from Shane Walsh and Damien Comer.
