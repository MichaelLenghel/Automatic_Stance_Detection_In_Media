ERNIE ELS has always considered the Murphy's Irish Open among his favourite tournaments and he will be on show again when the event returns to the Druid's Glen in County Wicklow next July (2-5). Because of a commitment to Jack Nicklaus's Memorial Tournament in the US Tour he missed last year's Irish Open which Colin Montgomerie won with a sensational final round of 62. One presumes that the five times European number one will be back to defend the title and attempt to emulate Nick Faldo's unique hat-trick of '91, '92 and '93. Els and Monty have had some rare battles in the past like in the US Open at Congressional last year when the South African beat the Scot by a single shot in a dramatic final round. It was Els' second US Open title and the following week he won the Buick Classic to bring his career haul of victories to 20. These include a unique hat-trick of Toyota World Matchplay titles and he was foiled of a fourth title in-a-row when he lost in the final by one hole to Vijay Singh last year. The 28-year-old from Johannesburg had the most emotional moment of his golfing career in November of 1996 when he and Wayne Westner won the World Cup on home ground but it was a title they lost to Ireland last November. Also returning to the Murphy's Irish Open is Jose Maria Olazabal. Winner of the title at Portmarnock in 1990, the former Masters champion, has made a remarkable recovery from Rheumatoid Polyarthritis which kept him out of the game for 18 months and threatened his entire career. The Spaniard's courage manifested itself with victory in the Turespana Masters and seven other top ten finishes last year. He also made the Ryder Cup team and played a major role in Europe's success at Valderrama in September. Tiger on top of world TIGER WOODS' amazing comeback victory in the Johnnie Walker Classic has helped him widen the gap at the top of the world rankings. Woods, who fired a last round 65 to force a play-off with one-time runaway leader Ernie Els before winning his first tournament of the year at the second extra hole, is clear of Greg Norman, with South African Els back in third.
