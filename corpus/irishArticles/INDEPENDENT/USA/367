Rory McIlroy's dramatic victory in the BMW PGA Championship has lifted him four places in the latest world rankings. McIlroy moves up from 10th to sixth following his one-shot win over Ireland's Shane Lowry at Wentworth, with the two-time major winner only taking the outright lead for the first time on the 71st hole. Sweden's Henrik Stenson has climbed to second after finishing joint seventh behind McIlroy, but that was not enough to overtake number one Adam Scott. Scott could have lost top spot after just a week if he had finished outside the top 13 in the Crowne Plaza Invitational, but ended up beating Jason Dufner in a play-off at Colonial. Latest leading positions and points averages: 1 Adam Scott (Aus) 8.94, 2 Henrik Stenson (Swe) 7.78, 3 Tiger Woods (USA) 7.64, 4 Matt Kuchar (USA) 7.03, 5 Bubba Watson (USA) 6.96, 6 Rory McIlroy (NIrl) 6.91, 7 Jason Day (Aus) 6.50, 8 Sergio Garcia (Spa) 6.16, 9 Justin Rose (Eng) 6.05, 10 Jordan Spieth (USA) 6.00, 11 Phil Mickelson (USA) 5.64, 12 Jim Furyk (USA) 5.42, 13 Zach Johnson (USA) 5.24, 14 Dustin Johnson (USA) 4.84, 15 Jason Dufner (USA) 4.50, 16 Luke Donald (Eng) 4.37, 17 Jimmy Walker (USA) 4.28, 18 Graeme McDowell (NIrl) 4.25, 19 Steve Stricker (USA) 4.16, 20 Charl Schwartzel (Rsa) 4.11 Online Editors
