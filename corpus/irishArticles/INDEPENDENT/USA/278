The ghost of Michael Jackson is scaring off the potential buyers of his Neverland Ranch is California, according to his neighbour who believes his spirit is still roaming the halls. Marie Andrade said that workers on the ranch, which is now on the market for €92m, have often spotted the Prince of Pop walking through the grounds of the 2,700-acre estate. “Michael is there, his presence, his moves and his breath. Many of the workers around the property have seen him, and they talk about him living there. It does spook many of them out.” The Thriller musician bought the estate in 1987 for $19.5m (€17.75m) and rechristened it ‘Neverland’. He extensively renovated the mansion and its grounds, developing a carnival, a working steam train and a 50 seat cinema. The estate also housed many exotic animals including chimpanzees and elephants. A source from a Californian estate agent told The Daily Star: “Local people say that Jackson’s spirit has been haunting his estate and favourite hangouts since he died. “Investors and visitors considered buying the property are warned that workers on the ranch have claimed the King of Pop haunts the premises.”
