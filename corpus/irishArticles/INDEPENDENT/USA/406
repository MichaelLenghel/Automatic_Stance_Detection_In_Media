The new WBO middleweight champion Andy Lee has been given a hero's welcome after touching down in Shannon this afternoon. Ireland's newest world champion was greeted in Shannon at lunchtime by a hoard of well-wishers and is already planning a massive sporting event for his home county. Lee, who beat Russian Matt Korobov in Las Vegas with a sixth round stoppage for the vacant belt on Saturday, told Newstalk that the wheels were already in motion for a title defence at Thomond Park. Speaking about the reception he received at Shannon, he said: "It's a bit surreal. I just touched down in Shannon. I got a great reception. There are a lot of media and my family here. All in all very good. "Plans are being made already for a defence in Thomond Park in the summer, a defence of my title. My manager Adam Booth is working on it already. "It's been a long journey and it was really my last chance at a world title. I won it and I'm very grateful for it."  The former Olympian was very excited at the prospect of defending his title in front of his own people. "It would be fantastic, I've been there to watch Munster play so many times. "I've had certain dreams and one of them was winning a world title, the other was stepping off the plane in Shannon and I'm doing those right now and defending my title at Thomond would be another one."
