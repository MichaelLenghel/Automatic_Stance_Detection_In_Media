After his first defeat in over a decade, Jose Aldo is demanding a rematch with Ireland's Conor McGregor after surrendering his crown in just 13 seconds at UFC 194. The Notorious landed a sweet left cross to end Aldo's evening in spectacular fashion. Aldo's body language was very strange before the fight and despite being the more experienced fighter, it appeared as though the occasion had got the better of him. After the fight, Aldo demanded a rematch from inside the Octagon, a rematch which could be in Croke Park if UFC President Dana White holds true to his promise. A 1-PUNCH KO!

"I think we need a rematch, it was really not a fight." Asked if McGregor's goading over the past year had got to him, he added:  "It didn't affect me at all, I really don't care what he says. We're going to have to come back here and it's on the the next at this point." In a message to his fans, he said: "Thank for everyone watching in Brazil, this is sport, it's a fight and this is what happens.. I will be back. Online Editors
