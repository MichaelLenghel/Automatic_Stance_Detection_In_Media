TAKE your pick. Any one from over 20 players. Your guess is as good as anybody else's. ... TAKE your pick. Any one from over 20 players. Your guess is as good as anybody else's. A European, possibly even an Irishman, might win the 130th British Open at Royal Lytham and St Anne's today but the Lancashire links has stood solid against the best players in the world. Yesterday's third round was as tense and as exciting as any Open I have attended. The Irish challenge is strong. Predictably, Darren Clarke, ranked number nine in the world, battled it out all day to finish on five under par, just one behind the leaders. The surprise is the performance of Des Smyth. The 48-year-old from Drogheda produced a stunning best of the tournament 65 in the second round to come from the edge of taking an early flight home to be right up there with men a lot younger. And his 70 yesterday leaves him just one behind Clarke. "I'm in there with a chance and I certainly won't back off," said Smyth. "I've been there before in Troon in 1982 when I was just one shot off the lead with seven holes to play. I made a mistake then. I was too aggressive. I learnt my lesson and look forward to the challenge." There is a four-way tie at the top of the leaderboard: David Duval, Alex Cejka, Bernard Langer and Ian Woosnam. The latter two really turned back the clock with 67s to put themselves in the thick of the hunt for the title. If either wins it will be their first since 1997. Only a week ago Woosnam was not certain to be playing because he had yet to qualify and Langer was doubtful because of a back injury that put him out of the Scottish Open at Loch Lomond. Now the two 43-year-olds have the chance to be one of the oldest-ever winners of the title. With both fighting to earn Ryder Cup recalls as well, Woosnam said: "There is a lot at stake, but I'm not going to put too much pressure on myself. I've done that before and I'm just going to enjoy it." Only two weeks ago, he was talking in Ireland about becoming disenchanted with the game and was wishing he was at his home in Barbados or watching the Lions in Australia. But how things have suddenly changed. "These are special times," said the Welshman. "I'm in love with golf. I think the game is fantastic. I am going to play 52 weeks a year. How about that?" He was joking a touch about his year-round schedule, of course, but deadly serious when he added: "Anybody who is a British player wants to win the Open. This is my 20th Open. Only four top 10s is not a very good record. "Maybe I've been too aggressive and haven't thought my way around enough. Now maybe I'm older I accept knocking it into the middle of the green more. "Experience is going to be important tomorrow. You can't take a pin on at the wrong time and if you've been in that position before you're more likely to do the right thing." An eagle at the 11th propelled Woosnam into the spotlight. He then birdied the 15th and 17th, but bogeyed in between. Langer, who would have been even better placed but for a closing bogey, still does not feel 100%, and stated: "I'm getting a lot of treatment." On his position he said: "It feels great to be in contention for the tournament I've always wanted to win. "You get a fantastic reception on every hole. The crowd would probably love to see a European winner. "It's always a pleasure to play with Ian. We've been on lots of Ryder Cups together and we were close to our best out there." As for seeing his fellow German Alex Cejka up there and for a while clear on his own Langer said: "That's the surprise. Alex has not been having that great a year. "I've always thought he could make it to the top he's been an under-achiever so far. I see a lot of potential. He has a lot of ability and a great swing and sometimes the putting holds him back." Langer had six birdies, but his par on the 15th was perhaps the highlight. A three-wood tee shot ran into a bunker he did not think he could reach and his recovery hit the face and flew sideways. From there, though, he struck a six-iron and holed a 40-foot putt. Tiger Woods can only make a successful defence of his title at Royal Lytham if he does something he has never achieved before. But first he must rediscover a swing that at times totally deserted him in his third round 73. After running up a double bogey seven on the seventh hole and then finishing with an equally wild bogey, Woods is only one under par and deep in the pack going into the closing 18 holes. In the six major titles he has won so far in his career Woods has either been out in front or sharing top spot entering the final day. Playing catch-up is alien. The American challenge is headed by David Duval. Labelled one of the best players never to win a Major, he made his bid early on with a great round of 65 to spring into contention at six under par. He has been the bridesmaid in Majors so many times that he could have been labelled a failure when it came to the crunch. The big disappointments from an Irish point of view were the failures of Pádraig Harrington and Paul McGinley to sustain a challenge. Both of them got into position but yesterday was a bad day. McGinley was four under par with the last four to play on Friday but hit three bogeys in a row to drop down the list. Harrington, on the other hand, raced into a reasonable situation with a superb 65 but fell away with an undistinguished 74. His day was ruined by a brace of sixes at the seventh and eighth, the first for a bogey and the second for a double. "Obviously I'm disappointed. I didn't play all that badly but this course requires you to play well all the time. It asks so many questions. If you can't answer you suffer." McGinley has been one of the most consistent players on the European Tour this year but there seems to be something missing. He has moved forward on all the ladders, the World Ranking, the Volvo Order of Merit and the Ryder Cup but he needs a victory. His poor finish on Friday was compounded by a one over par 72 yesterday. All he can hope for today is a decent score to improve his chances of becoming the third Irishman on the European Ryder Cup team. Harrington and Clarke have already booked their automatic places on the 12-man squad for The Belfry next month.
