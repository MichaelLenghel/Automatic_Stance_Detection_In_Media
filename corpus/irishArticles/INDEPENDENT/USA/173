Former Miss USAs have expressed their concern for the bikini bodies of this year's crop of beauty queens, who were "much too thin" and would prefer seeing healthier role models vying for the crown.  Former Miss USA pageant queens have expressed her concern for this year's contestants vying for the crown, saying their BMIs would reflect an unhealthy weight. Miss America 2008 Kirsten Haglund, who represented the US in Miss Universe, said she was very concerned for the wellbeing of those taking part in the 2013 pageant, in which Miss Connecticut Erin Brady was eventually crowned winner.  "The girls, I thought, were much too thin," she said. "I agree that if you would have tested their BMIs that they probably would have been much too thin. And that's the standard in the modeling industry and the fashion industry as well." Fellow title-holder, Miss USA 2003 Susie Castillo, said she was also "shocked" at the extremely slim figures of this year's contestants.  "I was a little shocked, too, sitting in the audience and seeing ribcages showing, protruding from these girls' skins," she explained. "I was like, 'Wow, these girls…' "
