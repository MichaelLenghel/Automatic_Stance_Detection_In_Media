Christian Bale has blasted George Clooney for whining about paparazzi problems. Both men formerly starred as Batman, but Christian can't relate to his fellow caped crusader when it comes to dealing with waiting photographers. Speaking to WSJ. Magazine, the Oscar winner says he finds George's complaints boring. “It doesn’t matter that he talks about it. It’s like, ‘Come on, guys, just shut up. Just get on with it and live your lives and stop whining about it.’ I prefer not to whine about it," he added. While the 40-year-old actor prefers to avoid confrontation with photographers, he does concede they often try to rile him - but he doesn't give them satisfaction of biting. Reports of Christian's fiery temper have hit the headlines in the past, and a sound clip of him going ballistic to crew on the set of Terminator Salvation was made public in 2009. However, these days he tries to stay cool headed. "I was in Italy with my wife [Sibi Blazic]. I would go to work; she would leave the hotel. There would be a man who stood outside... and [said] the most obscene things imaginable to my wife... I know what he’s after; he has a strategy there," he recalled. "Am I able to say I’m not gonna give him that satisfaction of angry Christian Bale coming after this man? But equally, he’s killing my humanity and my dignity as a husband if I do not, and he knows this. So you’ve got a choice.” Online Editors
