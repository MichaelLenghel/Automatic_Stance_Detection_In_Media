A ROW over whether or not Christianity should be mentioned in the preamble to the EU  constitution could frustrate efforts to negotiate a final agreement on the treaty before the  Irish presidency ends. Eight countries, led by Poland, have demanded a reference to Christianity be included in the preamble, with France and Belgium among those remaining opposed to such a move. A spokesman for the Department of the Taoiseach said: "As it stands, Christianity won't be mentioned, but nothing is agreed until it is finally agreed." The Government would prefer Christianity to be mentioned in the preamble but in its current role as EU president, it "is really looking for conciliation". On Thursday, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern said it was "unlikely" Christianity would be mentioned in the preamble. Mr Ahern has been touring European capitals seeking agreement on the constitution ahead of the June 17 meeting of the European council. Divisions within the EU over Christianity remain deep. In late May, seven member states - Italy, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Portugal, the Czech Republic and Slovakia - sent a letter to Mr Ahern demanding that there be a reference to Christianity. The letter said: "This issue remains a priority for our governments, but also for many representatives of the European parliament and of national parliaments, as well as for millions of European citizens." Greece has now joined the original seven states and the Netherlands has also indicated its support for a reference.
