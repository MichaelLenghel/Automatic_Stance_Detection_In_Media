Christian Benteke is the latest Liverpool signing this summer and Brendan Rodgers' squad has changed considerably from last season. Is this how the Anfield club will line up for their first Premier League clash of the season? Simon Mignolet Despite the arrival of Hungarian goalkeeper Adam Bogdan on a free transfer from Bolton, Mignolet will retain to No 1 jersey. The Belgian finished last season strongly despite suffering what he called football's versions of the yips at the back end of last year. Having been temporarily dropped by Rodgers, Mignolet says being told by his fianceé he was overthinking things made him change his ways and made him more decisive.

 Nathaniel Clyne in his new colours / Nathaniel Clyne England international is on the brink of a £12.5m switch from Southampton, who have now accepted the club's bid. The 24-year-old will solve the long-standing full-back problem at Anfield, exacerbated by Glen Johnson's Mamadou Sakho The £15million signing from PSG in 2013 has come a long way since storming out of the ground after being omitted from the squad for the Merseyside derby last September. A club fine followed, but rather than sit and stew, the French defender worked hard to establish himself as an integral member of Liverpool’s revamped system in the second half of last season.

 Martin Skrtel believes he should not have been hit with a three-match ban / Martin Skrtel The experienced head in Liverpool's back line - even though he lost it briefly last year when he was handed a three-game suspension for a stamp on Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea. The Slovakia international's current deal expires in 2016 but Rodgers is keen to keep him at Anfield. Alberto Moreno Started well last season after joining from Sevilla for £12million but faded as the campaign went on and attracted criticism from certain corners for his carelessness on the ball in dangerous situations - most memorably in the 4-1 defeat to Arsenal in April. Will need a vast improvement next season if he wants to hold on to his place. James Milner The 29-year-old gave up a supporting role at Manchester City to become one of Rodgers’ chief lieutenants at Liverpool following the departure of Steven Gerrard. The England international will add experience and endeavour to Rodgers' young squad and can act as a leader in the dressing room.

 Liverpool vice-captain Jordan Henderson, pictured, has issued a rallying cry to team-mates as they prepare for life without Steven Gerrard / Jordan Henderson Expected to take over the captaincy, England international signed a new deal at Anfield worth £100k-a-week at the back end of last season. Henderson's game has evolved under Rodgers and his performances have seen him blossom into one of Roy Hodgson's best midfielders. Emre Can German is a potential heir to Gerrard and after a slow start at Anfield, he now looks the part and is mature beyond his 21 years of age. Was effective when he slotted into Rodgers' three-man defence at the turn of the year but is more likely to start in midfield in what will probably be a 4-2-3-1 formation next season.

 Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke remains one of Liverpool's targets for the summer transfer window GLYN KIRK/AFP/Getty Images / Christian Benteke The Aston Villa striker had been Liverpool's No1 target and now they finally have their man. Philippe Coutinho The 22-year-old was Liverpool’s most improved player and his work-rate and tenacity is an example to the likes of Mario Balotelli. Brazilian playmaker will be expected to chip in with a few more goals while Roberto Firmino finds his feet. Roberto Firmino Liverpool's newest recruit and, at £28m, their priciest one to date. Firmino's 23 Bundesliga goals over the last two seasons with Hoffenheim equalled that of Marco Reus and was only three fewer than Thomas Muller. If given time to settle in England, the Brazilian could be the goalscoring ingredient that Liverpool so badly lacked last season, especially with Daniel Sturridge set to miss the start of the campaign with injury.
