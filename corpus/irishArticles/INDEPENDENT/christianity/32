Liverpool have completed the £32.5m signing of Christian Benteke, with the Belgian striker saying he moved to Anfield because he felt he had more opportunities of winning silverware. Following a two-day medical held in London and finally concluded on Merseyside, Benteke's switch to Anfield from Aston Villa on a five-year deal was confirmed last night. The 24-year-old becomes Brendan Rodgers's eighth new arrival this summer, taking Liverpool's spending beyond £80m. "It was the right club for me because I had a good chat with the manager and I wanted to be part of his project," said Benteke. "There are quality players here, a lot of good players with big names of course. I'm happy to be part of this team and will (try) to help this team reach its goals. "I came here to win trophies. It's about winning trophies. It's about doing something in my career I can maybe explain to my son or my kids what I did." He will begin training at Melwood today with Liverpool's pre-season fixture in Helsinki on August 1 likely to be his first appearance for his new club. Rodgers says Mario Balotelli can leave this summer. It has been evident that the Italian is not part of his plans for the new season. "It is up to Mario (whether he will be a Liverpool player next season.). I am not sure. We'll see when the season begins," said Rodgers. (© Daily Telegraph, London) Telegraph.co.uk
