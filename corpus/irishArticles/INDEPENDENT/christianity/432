Christian Eriksen gave Tottenham the lead after only 11 seconds against Manchester United on Wednesday night. But his speedy strike is edged out by another Spurs favourite on the all-time list. Here, Press Association Sport looks back at the fastest goals in Premier League history. Ledley King (2000): Bradford 3 Tottenham 3 (10 seconds) Spurs defender King is the unlikely holder of the fastest goal in Premier League history. A hopeful ball forward was met with a tame header back out and King lashed a deflected shot in from 20 yards at Valley Parade. 
 AND STILL....... pic.twitter.com/0sc2OyJDkx Alan Shearer (2003): Newcastle 2 Man City 0 (10 seconds) Toon hero Shearer was quick off the mark when he charged down City goalkeeper Carlo Nash’s attempted clearance and poked home the loose ball from a tight angle. Christian Eriksen (2017): Tottenham v Man Utd (11 seconds) A long ball forward was flicked on by Harry Kane and though Dele Alli failed to get a shot away, Eriksen followed up to curl expertly past David De Gea with his left foot. 
 QUICK AS A FLASH!!! pic.twitter.com/Bqt9HBBzim Mark Viduka (2001): Charlton 1 Leeds 2 (11 seconds) Leeds’ Australian frontman was never renowned for his pace but he was too quick for Charlton. Alan Smith rose to flick on a long ball from Ian Harte and Viduka did the rest. Dwight Yorke (1995): Coventry 0 Aston Villa 3 (13 seconds) Straight from kick-off Mark Draper sent Ian Taylor clear down the right and he put in a perfect cross which Yorke was able to steer home in double-quick time. Chris Sutton (1995): Everton 1 Blackburn 2 (13 seconds) One half of Blackburn’s deadly strike partnership with Shearer, Sutton also wasted no time in hitting the back of the net as Rovers took another stride towards the title. Asmir Begovic (2013): Stoke 1 Southampton 1 (13 seconds)

 Asmir Begovic celebrates his quickfire goal PA Archive/PA Images / Yes, that’s right. A goalkeeper. Artur Boruc was the unlucky man at the other end as he watched Begovic’s punt bounce over him. It is also the longest goal in football history, measured at 91.9 metres. Jesus Navas (2013): Man City 6 Tottenham 0 (14 seconds) A wayward kick from Spurs goalkeeper Hugo Lloris fell to Sergio Aguero. Lloris denied the Argentinian a possible record but Navas was following up and tucked away the rebound. PA Media
