The glistening lipstick story continues at Dior's Haute Couture autumn/winter 2013 show. Dior always makes a statement when it comes to make-up. And it probably has something to do with international make-up artist Pat McGrath working her creative, and always colourful, genius backstage for the French fashion house. For Dior's Haute Couture autumn/winter 2013 show it's the lipstick that's doing all the talking - again. McGrath created grown up glitter lips and piercing cerise for Dior's last two runway shows. And now for their latest Haute Couture catwalk she gives us the metallic, mirrored lip in bronze, lilac and dark rose. It's always texture that pushes beauty trends on, because while we may see the same colour on eyes, lips and cheeks season on season, it's the change in finish that the beauty industry is watching out for. In keeping with the reflective lip, made up - but blush free - faces were given glistening gold flecks in the inner corners of the eyes. Models blinked to reveal glassy, glossy lids, while iridescent pinks were pressed onto cheekbones and bare shoulders that gleamed against the light. Hair too, shone. Polished pin heads were pulled into simple slicked back low slung buns, with occasional gold ear cuffs or pearl clusters adding the only light-catching detail. Dior, under McGrath, have taken beauty in a new mirrored direction, a make-up move that we will no doubt see more of. As seen on Telegraph.co.uk
