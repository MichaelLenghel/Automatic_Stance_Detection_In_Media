The ancient law of blasphemy was dealt a near fatal blow yesterday when the High Court in London rejected efforts by Christian campaigners to bring a prosecution over 'Jerry Springer -- the Opera'. Christian Voice, an evangelical group, had hoped to sue the BBC for blasphemous libel over the screening of the controversial show in 2005. But two judges said that broadcasters and theatres were exempt from blasphemy actions which could anyway be successful only if the material was so scurrilous as to shake the "fabric" of society and "cause civil strife". Lawyers said it was difficult to envisage any written attack on Christianity provoking widespread unrest in an increasingly secular society. They hailed the judgment as a victory for free speech, saying that it would limit prosecutions to the written word. The judges said that in the past any attack on Christianity would have been regarded as endangering society "because of the identity of Church and state and the near universality of Christian conviction in this country". Now, however, blasphemy could not be proved "merely because some people of particular sensibility are ... moved to protest". Stephen Green, the national director of Christian Voice, said the ruling had torn out" the "guts of the law" against blasphemy. He said he would seek a ruling in the House of Lords. The corporation received a record 63,000 complaints when the musical was broadcast in January 2005. Mr Green said its scenes depicting Christ wearing a nappy and swearing had "clearly crossed the blasphemy threshold". But the judges said it was reasonable to conclude that 'Jerry Springer -- The Opera' could not be considered as blasphemous because it was not aimed at Christianity but was merely a parody of the chat show genre.
