TWO thousand years have passed since Joseph and Mary suffered the most famous lock-out in Christian history, but the times, it seems, have come full circle. Today, it is less a question of lack of hotel space as age-old, deeply acrimonious, religious rivalry. Christian pilgrims to Israel and the Palestinian Authority later this month will find they cannot enter the church supposedly marking the spot where the Archangel Gabriel first told Mary to expect a child. Nor will they be able to genuflect before the place of the crucifixion, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem's Old City. Christian leaders in the Holy Land yesterday issued an announcement addressed to ``all Ambassadors, Local Christians, Christian Pilgrims and Travel Agents,'' declaring that all their sanctuaries will be closed on Monday and Tuesday, November 22-23. The shut-down, which comes as Israel prepares for a flood of Christian tourists, is meant as a protest against a decision by the Israeli government to allow a mosque to be built in Nazareth, close to the Basilica of the Annunciation (where Christians believe Gabriel appeared befor Mary). The issue has for months been a source of fierce contention in the town of Christ's childhood, causing riots, demonstrations, an attack on the mayor, and a threat by the Vatican to cancel a Papal visit to Israel pencilled in for next spring. Relations between Christian and Muslim groups have been steadily fraying as the Christians prepare for their millennium festivities, battered by complaints that the Israeli police have been unfairly deporting some of the odder Christian pilgrims claiming they are members of extreme doomsday cults. As fate would have it, New Year's day and Christmas both fall on a Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath, when the city's ultra-Orthodox forbid so much as popping a champagne cork.  Independent News Service
