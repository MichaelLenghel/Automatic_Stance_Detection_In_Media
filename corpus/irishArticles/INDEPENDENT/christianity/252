Fifty Shades Of Grey fans can finally get a peek inside Christian Grey's flat in the upcoming movie. The film's director Sam Taylor-Johnson gives a tour around the billionaire's Escala penthouse, which consists of floor-to-ceiling windows, marble floors and a grand piano in a new behind-the-scenes clip.  "Christian Grey's apartment was quite phenomenal as a set. That was exciting to see," she said.  "It's important to feel Ana's world - the sweet, charming existence - and Christian's world - the huge voluminous apartment - just to create those two worlds and how they collide."  Jamie Dornan will portray Christian in the big-screen adaptation of EL James' erotic novel, alongside Dakota Johnson as his love interest Anastasia Steele.  Christian's home has been designed by David and Sandy Wasco. "The two of them came with such a vast knowledge and perfect sensibility for creating extraordinary spaces. We were going to create something that resonated with the readers of the book and their images of what it could be, but also something slightly other-worldly and extraordinary too," Sam explained. "But at the same time, it had to exist as something very real so it was a great collaboration."  Fifty Shades Of Grey will open in UK cinemas on February 13.  PA Media
