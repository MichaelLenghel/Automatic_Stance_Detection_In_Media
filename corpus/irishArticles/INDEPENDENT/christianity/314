Sir - I want to take issue with the comments made by Ian O'Doherty  (ISpy, May  10). As a Christian, I strongly object to his implication that a Christian can't be a rationalist i.e. a person who approaches life on a logical and commonsense basis Sir - I want to take issue with the comments made by Ian O'Doherty 
(ISpy, May 10). As a Christian, I strongly object to his implication that a Christian can't be a rationalist i.e. a person who approaches life on a logical and commonsense basis. I base what I believe not on what I am told to believe but on the fact that the 
Bible proves itself to correspond to the real world. The 
Bible stands up to scientific, archaeological and philosophical/logical scrutiny. I consider myself a rationalist and that is how I approach the world. I know many other Christians who are the same. The two (Christianity and rationalism) are not mutually exclusive. In this context, the article's reference to Christianity as having been "the driving superstition on our continent for millennia" is totally inappropriate. I don't know what definition of "superstition" Mr O'Doherty subscribes to but, to my knowledge, the term does not encompass something that is rooted in history and that is logically sound (Christianity). Following on from this, Mr O'Doherty went on to say: "I couldn't care less whether you worship Jesus, Satan or the Jolly Green Giant . . . keep it out of public life." What is missing in this line of thinking is the fact that it is a fundamental truth that our beliefs and our most deeply held principles will always and inevitably impact public life. This means that our beliefs are of paramount importance and are not to be given the sort of flippant treatment dealt out in this article. Ronan Callanan,
