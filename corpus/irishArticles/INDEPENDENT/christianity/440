AMERICA'S Christian conservatives have turned their heavy guns on Jane Fonda, accusing her of being intolerant, insensitive and inflammatory after the actress's recent remarks that the Religious Right was concerned only with the welfare of ``the white middle-class.'' Christian ire was provoked by Ms Fonda when she spoke on Wednesday at a National Press Club luncheon in Washington. The subject was teenage pregnancy a theme on which the actress and ``the moral majority'' have little in common. Asked why Christian conservatives believe programmes to prevent teenage pregnancy should not include birth-control information, Ms Fonda said: ``They don't care about children that don't look like them. They don't care about children that are not white, middle-class Christians. As far as they're concerned, others can be eliminated.'' For good measure, she added: ``This is a holy war, and everything for our children is at stake.'' Ms Fonda was speaking in her capacity as chairwoman of the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention, funded mainly by her husband, the media tycoon Ted Turner. Robert Peters, president of the Morality in Media group, said the actress was one of the ``radical, liberal condom-wavers who view heterosexual, life-long, monogamous marriage as undermining their goals for equality and liberation.'' Clearly furious, Mr Peters said: ``Protection is not a long-term solution. Morality is. The true liberal concern ends there with condoms. They don't see teen sex as immoral. Many liberals don't want kids to accept traditional moral values.'' Randy Tate, executive director of the Christian Coalition, demanded that Ms Fonda apologise immediately and unreservedly. ``People of faith across the nation are deeply saddened by [her] intolerant and insensitive comments,'' he said. They ``do nothing to advance the causes of racial reconciliation or reduce the tragic number of teen pregnancies and out-of-wedlock births.'' He pointed out that the Christian Coalition had provided money to rebuild black churches destroyed by arson last year. Gary Bauer, president of the powerful Family Research Council, was also incensed. ``It's outrageous, bigoted and hateful. I wish the Jane Fondas of this world would debate the issues without lapsing into this kind of vicious attack.''  ( The Times, London)
