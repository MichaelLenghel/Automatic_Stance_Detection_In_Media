IT WAS the Christian thing to do. But that doesn't make it any less sad. Last week Christian Stokes broke off his engagement to long-term girlfriend Lisa Dillon and cancelled his booking at Dromoland Castle. It's not known whether Lisa is considering throwing her Christian to the lions, but sources close to them say they are still good friends. For years, the two of them were one of Dublin's most visible couples. Lisa and Christian seemed inseparable and head-over-heels in love, living together in an apartment beside the Radisson Hotel in Stillorgan. Christian drives David Beckham's former Ferrari (which cost him a mere ?200,000) and gave Lisa a blue Mini Cooper as a Christmas present last year. Christian, 26, is the owner of Bang restaurant and the Clarendon Bar with twin brother Simon. With fashion maven Pia Bang and Unicorn owner Jeff Stokes as glamorous parents, Christian's wedding was always going to be one of the society soirees of 2004 (Simon got married on an island in Denmark last summer). Onward Christian soldiers. BE
