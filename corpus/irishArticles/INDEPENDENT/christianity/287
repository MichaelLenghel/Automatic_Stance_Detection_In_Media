Geri Halliwell has stepped out publicly with her Formula One boss fiance for the first time to support Prince Harry at a charity polo match in Abu Dhabi. The former Spice Girl, who famously pinched the Prince of Wales' bottom at an awards ceremony, joined guests at an exclusive polo club to cheer Harry on. Her engagement to Red Bull boss Christian Horner was announced in a newspaper advert and she was brimming with happiness at her impending wedding. She spoke publicly about her engagement for the first time as she posed for pictures at the Ghantoot Racing and Polo Club. "We're absolutely delighted. I'm really happy, he's gorgeous," she said. Horner was a little tight-lipped and declined to say when the couple would marry, but said they were in the Gulf state for the title-deciding Abu Dhabi Grand Prix this weekend. Halliwell went on to praise Harry, whose charity Sentebale works with disadvantaged youngsters, many living with HIV, in the African nation of Lesotho. The polo game was a closely fought match in front of invited guests who included Formula One veteran Sir Jackie Stewart and Downton Abbey actor Dan Stevens.
