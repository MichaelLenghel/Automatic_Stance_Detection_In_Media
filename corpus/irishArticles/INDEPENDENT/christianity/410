 / He told how the plate on Sean's coffin read, 'The Glory of God and the Honour of Ireland', "a maxim by which he lived". Mr Potts, originally from Dublin’s Drimnagh, is mourned by his wife Bernie, daughters and sons, Cora, Sean Og, Sorcha and Ultan, and a wide circle of siblings, relatives and friends.  It was in 1962 that the master tin whistle player, alongside his friend Paddy Moloney, set up the group in Dublin that inspired generations of traditional musicians and made Irish traditional music popular around the world. His talents also extended to a variety of instruments including the bones and the bodhran. From first playing in Paddy’s home the group went on to tour extensively and play famous stages throughout the world. After leaving The Chieftains in 1979, he had went on to become the honorary president of Na Piobairi Uilleann (The Associaiton of Uilleann Pipers). According to the band’s website it was pressures from the extensive touring that led to his departure, including a “particularly hair raising episode when flying through a storm in 1979 during their North American tour”. Mr Potts, who had originally started out with Irish traditional band, Ceoltoiri Chualann, founded by Sean O Riada, later went on to found Bakerswell which toured successfully in the US. Moloney, who is the US, still leads The Chieftains, with 58 albums recorded and six Grammy awards. The funeral cortege was travelling to Dardistown Cemetery after Mass for his burial.
