Jamie Dornan has revealed that losing his mother to pancreatic cancer when he was just 16 was one of the reasons he was interested in playing Christian Grey. Dornan (32) signed on to play the lead male role in the big screen adaptation of EL James' erotic bestseller 50 Shades of Grey after Sons of Anarchy actor Charlie Hunnam dropped out. In an interview with Details magazine, the Northern Irish actor said his mother's death influenced his role choice. He said it had to do with "an attraction and understanding I have for people that are broken in some way. "Not that I'm some broken bird, but there's a massive element of me that's fractured from losing my mother so young, and I'm drawn to characters who are wounded." Christian Grey is an emotionally distant twenty-something billionaire with film star good looks and a penchant for BDSM, a discipline in which he schools a young writer, played by Dakota Johnson. However, Dornan told the magazine he could not relate to those aspects of the character. "Christian's wild level of achievement and success at such a young age," he said. "Christian's power—I don't really have any." Dornan has previously spoken about researching for the role at a Vancouver S&M dungeon.  However, he said he didn't participate and found it "intriguing" rather than arousing. "Even if you didn't have Christian's history of childhood abuse and abandonment, I totally understand why a person would be into it. Something like trainspotting or planespotting? I actually don't get that. But I do understand the psychology of being tied up and getting turned on." Online Editors
