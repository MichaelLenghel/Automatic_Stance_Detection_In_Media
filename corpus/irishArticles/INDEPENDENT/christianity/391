THE Christian Brothers are handing over the final €6.8m of their commitment to the fund for survivors of residential institutional child abuse. The money is being paid in a series of monthly transfers between this month and December, with €1.8m handed over this week. It represents the final payment to the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund, to which religious congregations that ran institutions pledged a total contribution of €110m. The Christian Brothers have contributed €30m to the fund. The Fund supports the needs of thousands of survivors of child abuse in the institutions, who received awards from the Residential Institutions Redress Board or equivalent court awards. The funding and other support services for the survivors are provided by Caranua, an independent State body Education Minster Joe Mc Hugh welcomed “the clear confirmation from the Christian Brothers of its plan to complete its pledge.” He said the confirmation “provided both funding and much needed clarity for Caranua to allow it to continue its supports for survivors.” Under the provisions of legislation that established the Fund in 2002, any amount in excess of €110 million goes to the funding of the National Children’s Hospital. Of the remainder of the Christian Brothers’ pledge, €6.4m will go to the Fund and almost €429,000 will go to the National Children’s Hospital. At the end of July, Caranua had received €105m, including interest of €1.4m and has spent about €100m, of which €89m has gone to funding supports for survivors and €11.7m on operational costs.
