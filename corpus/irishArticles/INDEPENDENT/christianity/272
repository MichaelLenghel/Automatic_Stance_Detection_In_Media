Six Christians, including four women, were burnt alive in clashes with majority Muslims in a town in central Pakistan yesterday, officials said. Tension has been running high between the two communities in Gojra town in central Punjab province over allegations that Christians had desecrated a Koran. Clashes erupted early yesterday, with an exchange of fire between members of both communities. Television footage showed burning houses and streets strewn with blackened furniture and people firing at each other from their rooftops. Shahbaz Bhatti, minister for minorities, said a mob "misled by religious extremists", attacked a Christian neighbourhood and torched dozens of houses. "We have received six bodies of people who died of burn injuries. They included four women, one man and one child," Abdul Hamid, a health ministry official in the town said. Rana Sanaullah, provincial minister for law, who is also responsible for security matters of Punjab, condemned the attack and said an inquiry had been ordered. However, he said, a preliminary investigation showed there was no desecration of the Koran. "It was just a rumour which was exploited by anti-state elements to create chaos," he said. "I request both Muslim and Christian communities to show restraint." He said the government would take strict action against rioters and police who failed to stop this kind of violence. Pakistan is a predominantly Muslim nation and religious minorities, including Christians, account for roughly 4 per cent of the 170 million population. There have been periodic attacks on Christian targets since Pakistan became a US ally following the September 11 attacks on the US in 2001.
