A group of elderly Christian Brothers have failed in their bid to prevent a 72-bedroom extension of a hotel formerly owned by Ireland soccer star, Niall Quinn. This follows An Bord Pleanála dismissing the appeal by the five Christian Brothers, aged between 69 and 88, and six other parties against the Kildare Co Council decision to grant planning permission to the extension to Lawlor's hotel in Naas. The hotel lies adjacent to the Christian Brothers' St Patrick's Monastery.  The Christian Brothers have had a presence in Naas since 1871 and constructed the monastery there in 1902. Plans were lodged for the four-storey extension in June of last year, when Quinn was still the majority shareholder in the business. It is understood that he has since sold on his shareholding and no longer has an interest in the business. In the appeal, consultants for the Christian Brothers claimed that the proposal would fall within two metres of the monastery boundary "and will cause a significant loss of residential amenity currently enjoyed by the Christian Brothers". The appeal stated that the garden to the rear of the monastery "is a private, tranquil environment... which will be disturbed". The board inspector stated that the impact on the order were not serious in nature. Indo Business
