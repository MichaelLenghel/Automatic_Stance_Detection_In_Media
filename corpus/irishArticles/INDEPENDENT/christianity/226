Christian Eriksen's braced fired Spurs in the Capital One Cup final last night and his opening goal was a beauty but was it the best scored this week? Here's Eriksen's first-half free-kick which sent Twitter into overdrive last night:  Bojan Krkic was also on form on Monday night with a delicious volley in Stoke's victory over Rochdale. Unfortunately he injured his cruciate in the game and is expected to spend a very long time in recovery.  Carles Gil endeared himself to Aston Villa fans with an amazing goal on his full debut for the club in the victory over Championship leaders Bournemouth on Sunday.  Gylfi Sigurdsson scored this screamer in Swansea's shock defeat at the hands of Blackburn Rovers last Saturday and got sent off for a petulant tackle in injury time.  Dublin Mark Yeates scored what must be the most watched goal of the week when sealing Bradford's shock 4-2 win Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.  Vote for your favourite goal below: Online Editors
