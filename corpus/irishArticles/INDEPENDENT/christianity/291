The Christian Brothers are currently planning to end two centuries of direct involvement in primary and secondary education in Ireland, including two schools in New Ross. It will mark the end of an era for New Ross town, which has a CBS Primary and CBS Secondary School, both founded by the Christian Brothers in 1849. The Christian Brothers are finalising arrangements at the moment to hand over 29 primary and 109 secondary schools to a charitable trust run entirely by lay people - the Edmund Rice Schools Trust (ERST). Principal of New Ross CBS Secondary School, Ray Murray said the necessity for change was largely driven by the decline in the number of Christian Brothers and the ageing profile of those remaining. Mr. Murray said it make no difference to the day-to-day running of the school as the ERST would be looking after the management of the school at a level above the Board of Management. Mr. Murray said that the main change now will be that when the Board of Management have issues that they need to go up the line to sort out they won't be dealing with Christian Brothers anymore, but with the members of the ERST. The CBS Primary School is in a different situation as it is a Parish School run by the Diocese of Ferns. However, when the school moves to a new green field site as part of its proposed amalgamation with the town's other primary schools, its Mount St. Joseph site will revert to the Christian Brothers. A charter outlining the education and religious philosophy of ERST schools will be launched next September.
