(Photo by Bryan Bedder/Getty Images for The Fragrance Group) / The 30-year-old star wore a high necked mini dress, embellished with cream ostrich feathers and beads. In typical fashion, she added her signature masculine twist in clunky black patent boots and a patent black box bag.  Christian Siriano has gone from strength to strength since winning the fourth season of Project Runway.  Currently displaying his creations in a pop up shop in New York's Meatpacking District, he was joined by celebrities including Marisa Tomei, Mena Suvari, and models Leigh Lezark and Coco Rocha. Canadian model Coco Rocha (25) has been enlisted as the face of his eau de parfum. Siriano dressed Modern Family actress for last week’s Emmy awards, cementing his status as a favourite among the young and stylish A list.
