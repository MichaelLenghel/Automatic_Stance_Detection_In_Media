Paramilitary troops patrolled the streets of a town in eastern Pakistan yesterday after Muslim radicals burnt to death eight members of a Christian family, sparking fears of violence spreading to other areas. Hundreds of armed supporters of Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, an outlawed Islamic militant group, set alight dozens of Christian homes in Gojra town, Punjab, at the weekend after allegations that a copy of the Koran had been defiled. The mob opened fire indiscriminately, threw petrol bombs and looted houses as thousands of frightened Christians ran for safety. "They were shouting anti-Christian slogans and attacked our houses," said Rafiq Masih. Gojra has a Christian population of about 50,000. Police and local officials said at least eight people, including four women and a child, were killed in the fires. Two others died of gunshot wounds. Residents said the casualties were much higher; one claimed the number of dead could be in the dozens. Shahbaz Bhatti, the minister for minorities, said 40 Christian homes were torched in rioting. He said there was no truth to the allegations and accused the police of ignoring his appeal to provide protection to Christians. (©The Times, London)
