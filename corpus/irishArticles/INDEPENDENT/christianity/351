Christian Bale has reportedly been offered 50 million dollars (£32 million) to reprise his role as Batman in the Justice League film. Warner Bros has begun production on a Justice League movie, a DC Comics Avengers-style ensemble film with superheroes such as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and Green Lantern uniting to fight evil powers. Christian - who played Bruce Wayne, aka the Caped Crusade, in Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy - recently said in an interview he had had "enough" of the role. But new eBook Beyond Batman: The Unauthorised True Story of Christian Bale and His Dark Knight Dilemma by Vincent Russel has quoted a source from Legendary Pictures saying the studio is determined to get him on board. The insider said: "Why would Christian Bale walk away from what is certainly going to be either the first or second highest grossing movie in the history of cinema? "He could probably make 50 million dollars for being in the movie 20 minutes. And it would be worth every penny to the studio." The book added: "Sources close to Christian Bale have reportedly begun expressing their suspicions that Bale now views the Batman films in the same light that Robert Downey Jr views the Iron Man films." Downey Jr has been happy to reprise his role as Iron Man in the blockbuster franchise and spin-off movies, while balancing his career with other projects to avoid becoming typecast. But Christian told Entertainment Weekly last month: "We were incredibly fortunate to get to make three [Batman films]. That's enough. Let's not get greedy. "It's a torch that should be handed from one actor to another. So I enjoy looking forward to what somebody else will come up with." PA Media
