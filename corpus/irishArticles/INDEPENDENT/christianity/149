 / And the couple decided to announce their engagement in a traditional fashion by running an ad in British newspaper The Times. “The engagement is announced between Christian, son of Mr and Mrs G.M.

 / PHOTOS:  The 42-year-old songstress has been dating Christian, 40, since the beginning of this year. Before their relationship took off, Geri had a brief but highly publicised romance with comedian Russell Brand. She was also romantically linked with British writer Sacha Gervasi in the past. Neither Geri nor Christian have ever married before, but the singer is mother to a seven-year-old daughter from a previous relationship. The stunning redhead addressed what she was looking for in an ideal love partner while speaking with Australian radio hosts Kylie and Jackie O in 2013. "I love when a man puts effort in! I just love effort; even if they embarrass themselves for love," she giggled. "That's my kinda guy, even if they're singing out of tune or are silly. They just jump the fence; they slay the dragon." Geri isn’t the only celebrity to have chosen to announce their engagement in a traditional manner. Actor Benedict Cumberbatch and his future wife Sophie Hunter, a renowned theatre and opera director, also decided to run a discreet ad in The Times last week to proclaim their impending marriage.
