The First Minister of Northern Ireland has described the decision to take a bakery to court over a pro-gay marriage cake slogan as “bonkers”. Peter Robinson has hit out at the Equality Commissions decision to fund legal action against a Co Antrim Baking Company. Ashers Bakery made international headlines during the week when it refused a customers request for a cake with a slogan supporting same-sex marriage. The DUP leader said the Commission needed to “wind their necks in” at a time when public funds were under pressure. "This kind of decision by the Equality Commission is bonkers,” he told the BBC. "I think they really do need to wind their necks in at a time when we're scraping around to get funding for essential services in Northern Ireland, they're tossing it into the courts," he added.

 The cake / The cake was ordered by a gay rights activist who wanted the cake to feature the slogan “support gay marriage” alongside a picture of Sesame Street characters Bert and Ernie. However, the Christian-run family firm declined the order because it was “at odds” with their beliefs and refused to pay compensation to the customer. Earlier this week, the Commission said they would prefer not to have to litigate. “This case raises issues of public importance regarding the extent to which suppliers of goods and services can refuse service on grounds of sexual orientation, religious belief and political opinion,” they said. "The Commission will be issuing a civil bill in this case and a decision as to whether or not discrimination has occurred will be a matter for the court,” they added. Online Editors
