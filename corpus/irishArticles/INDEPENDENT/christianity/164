Spurs are on their way to Wembley but they almost got held up in a snow drift and an ambush by a teenager.  Che Adams, an 18-year-old striker once watched by 45 scouts in his days at Ilkeston FC, came off the bench, scoring twice and scaring Spurs, who were then grateful for Christian Eriksen's second goal on the night. Eriksen was outstanding, lighting up the first half with a wonderful free-kick, before responding to the teenage kicks of Adams with a measured second. Eriksen killed off Sheffield United's dream but Nigel Clough's side played with real pride, showing their energy and commitment and almost reaching extra time, which would not have flattered them. So the Capital One final will be contested by the Capital Two, Spurs and Chelsea, a repeat of the 2008 final. They last met on New Year's Day when Chelsea dissolved 5-3. One problem for Spurs is that they are away at Fiorentina on Thursday, February 26, three days before the big date at Wembley. For their 5,500 fans who made the journey from London to Sheffield last night, such fixture congestion was the furthest thing from their minds. (© Daily Telegraph, London) Telegraph.co.uk
