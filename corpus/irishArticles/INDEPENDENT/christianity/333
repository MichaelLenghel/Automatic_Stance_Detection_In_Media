One of the most senior people in the Dublin office of Christian Aid Ireland is Peter Byrne from Bray. This year he will be heading up the agency's first ever 'Flag Day' in County Wicklow, which will be held on Bray's main street. Also this year is the Trade Justice Campaign which is aimed at Overseas Development Minister, Tom Kitt TD, which also involves Peter at a local and national level. Friends and supporters of Peter in Bray will be sending out their part of what will be a huge amount of postcards aimed at swamping Minister Kitt's desk ahead of his June 1 meeting in Dublin involving all 25 development ministers from the newly expanded European Union. The postcards will call on Minister Kitt to use his influence to persuade the EU to allow developing countries to protect the livelihoods of the world's poorest farmers and will then be distributed to anyone who wants them. Primarily, Christian Aid Ireland are aiming to organise the largest ever Irish 'Fairtrade Coffee Morning', which will be held all over the country during Christian Aid Week.
