Although I'm writing on behalf of the Presbyterian Church to give readers' Christmas greetings, I do not assume you're all pro-Christian or even pro-religion. Some of you will be, some will not. Although I'm writing on behalf of the Presbyterian Church to give readers' Christmas greetings, I do not assume you're all pro-Christian or even pro-religion. Some of you will be, some will not. For too long the Churches have assumed that Irish people see Christianity as the solution, not the problem. That is changing dramatically. Not only have we more Irish people of other faiths, but, increasingly, people of no faith at all. The world is changing, yet the Churches' model looks to the past when countries were theocratic i.e. one country, one religion. It gave the Churches power and influence but let's be honest too often they abused it. I believe that Christmas offers a very different model for the Churches. Jesus was not born in a palace but a stable. Mary and Joseph had no influence they couldn't even command a bed for the night! Yet as a Christian I believe Lo, he in a manger lies, he who built the starry skies.' If, as I also believe, God exists and most perfectly reveals himself to us in the face of Christ, then perhaps copying Jesus is a better model for Christians in an increasingly sceptical society?
