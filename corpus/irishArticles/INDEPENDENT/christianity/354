'CONCENTRATE on similarities while recognising differences' was the message from Archbishop Michael Jackson during last week's Christian Unity Service in Arklow. The service, which was held in St. Joseph's Church, Templerainey saw a number of clergy from across a number a religions taking part in the joint service for Christian Unity. Dr. Jackson, the Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin and Bishop of Glendalough, preached during the service which was organised as part of the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity. In his sermon he focused on wisdom and the Wisdom Literature in the Bible. The Archbishop said that wisdom was to be found among people. In this Week of Prayer for Christian Unity, he suggested that God was asking people to talk about God and with God. 'The fact that we already have unity in Christ means that we ought to be out and about conversing with God with confidence and compassion for all we're doing and for all that others are doing. Rather than our tearing our hair out about why we don't have even more visible unity, I want to make a simple suggestion and it is so simple that you may think it is not worth making.' He said that during this Week of Prayer for Christian Unity, Wisdom was asking people to have the confidence to take the gift of God and do three things: to do Mission, to do Witness and to do Sacrament. But he said that people could not continue to do these three things within their own familiar settings. 'We concentrate on the things which are similar, while recognising that we are also different. At the same time we all keep our eyes open for all the opportunities which are given us for Godly conversation, with God and with our neighbours. We begin to live at the crossroads and outside the churches,' he said. Bray People
