The challenges posed for children by the online world were recently explored by the pupils of Camolin NS who took part in a workshop on online safety. It was delivered by Graham Mulhern of the Wicklow-based besecureonline.co.uk, and he taught the children about issues such as online bullying, being nice online, and staying safe on the internet. 'Camolin National School is taking online safety seriously and tackling the issues that parents and kids worry about, like knowing who you are talking to online and why you should only talk to other children you already know,' he said. 'The online world can be hard for children to navigate, but the children in Camolin NS are now armed with the tools to enjoy their apps and social media, keeping their private information private and looking out for each other.' 'Online bullying and unhealthy competition among peers are things that children are worried about,' he added. 'It's not just teenagers who need the tools to tackle nastiness online.' 'We teach them how to think before they post and put themselves in other people's shoes,' he said. 'Camolin National School teaching staff are leading the way in helping kids learn about internet safety and how to enjoy all the online world has to offer, in a safe and fun way.'
