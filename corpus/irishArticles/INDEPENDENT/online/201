Controversial film 'The Interview' has become Sony's highest-selling online release of all time following it's pulling from mainstream theatres.  The buddy comedy starring Seth Rogen and James Franco was released online and in limited, independent cinemas after a cyber attack spurred mainstream theatres to refuse to show the film. It was released on YouTube, Google Play, Xbox video and Apple iTunes alongside the dedicated website See The Interview, powered by Sony's Kernel. The Interview earned over €12.3m, having seen two million rentals and purchases over the Christmas period. The film was on sale for $14.99 and available to rent for $5.99. Sony used Irish firm Stripe to accept the payments.

The film also made $2.8m from theatres in a limited release, with only 331 showings on it's Christmas Day debut. Seth Rogen said in a statement: "I'm so grateful that the movie found its way into theatres, and I'm thrilled that people actually went out and saw it." Sony's president of worldwide distribution said that the company are "very pleased with how it is doing both theatrically where we are seeing numerous sell-outs across the country, and online where it remains at the top of many charts". The film's Christmas Day release was initially cancelled as a result of the cinema's refusals to show the film, leading Barack Obama to say he felt they had made the "wrong decision". Following outcry over the cancellation, the film was released online and to independent theatres that agreed to show it. Many Twitter users claimed seeing the film was their "civic duty" and queues formed outside the small theatres showing the film on Christmas Day. North Korea denied any involvement in the cyber hacking of the company, which saw personal e-mails of Sony executives published online.   Read more: Online Editors
