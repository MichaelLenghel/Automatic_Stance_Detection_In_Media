Local Enterprise Office Wicklow will host a free Trading Online Voucher seminar in Wicklow County Campus, Rathnew in October. Consumer behaviour is changing and online spending is increasing rapidly. There is a big opportunity for Irish businesses to grow and access a wider market, expand their business and create more jobs. Statistics suggest that only 32 per cent of small companies are engaged in e-commerce sales in Ireland and that 70 per cent of the €850,000 spent online by Irish consumers per hour is going overseas.   The 'Trading Online Voucher' scheme, financed by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment aims to encourage small businesses to develop their online presence through a website or digital marketing strategy by availing of a Trading Online Voucher of up to €2,500 or 50 per cent of their eligible expenditure, whichever is the lesser. Businesses looking to apply for the Trading Online Voucher must be trading for a minimum of twelve months to qualify, employ less than 10 employees and be located in County Wicklow.  The seminar will help participants to understand and determine the best approach to establish and increase their online presence and trade online. Applicants for the Trading Online Voucher must attend a Trading Online Information Seminar.  This half day event takes place on Wednesday, October 16 from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. The trainer will be Noel Davidson, The Entrepreneurs Academy. Bray People
