SHOPPING online has never been more popular as the number of people making internet purchases continues to soar. Almost 500,000 people made online purchases last year, according to the Central Statistics Office (CSO), and the sector is experiencing double-digit growth. SHOPPING online has never been more popular as the number of people making internet purchases continues to soar. Almost 500,000 people made online purchases last year, according to the Central Statistics Office (CSO), and the sector is experiencing double-digit growth. Retailers would be foolish to ignore this dynamic growth area and should capitalise on it by getting an internet presence that helps promote their goods, said IBEC's Retail Ireland director Torlach Denihan. "Twenty years ago, all retailing was in bricks. In the future, it's going to be a mix of bricks and clicks," he said. However, while internet purchases had hit travel agents to a massive extent, this was unlikely to be the case with other retailers as most people still preferred to browse, try on and examine most items before purchasing, he said. Some 210,000 Irish people bought travel tickets and holidays online in the past 12 months, followed by 96,000 who bought books and magazines, and 90,000 who purchased films and music. However, Ireland is still a long way behind Britain where new figures from Verdict market analysts show the high street is losing out as every £1 (?1.55) out of £7 (?10) spent in the retail sector last year was for goods purchased from the comfort of home. The CSO said that some ?6.5bn, or 5.7pc of goods and services, are bought through e-commerce each year in Ireland. The CSO 2002 Service Inquiry - the latest available - suggested that 7.4pc of the turnover of retailers who offer internet sales were made online. Another CSO survey carried out in June 2004 showed that almost 200,000 people had spent more than ?100 on internet purchases in the previous three months and over 16,000 consumers bought more than ?2,000 worth of goods online in that time. Internet sales in those three months grew by 25pc over the same period in 2003 with almost 240,000 people making online purchases. Tesco Ireland said their online sales were growing 20pc year on year, and the average internet purchase was worth ?140 and consisted of 60 items. Surprisingly, fresh food such as milk, potatoes, seedless grapes, bananas, peppers, white bread, carrots, mince and Kelloggs' Special K were the most popular items purchased online last week, with nine-packs of toilet roll the only non-edible item in the top 10. The survey also reveals the typical internet customer is a woman aged between 25 and 45 with children.
