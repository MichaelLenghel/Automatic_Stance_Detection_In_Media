Deputy Andrew Doyle has welcomed the results of the Growing Small Business Through Online Trade report which shows that SMEs availing of the Government's online trading voucher are growing.  The report details the results of research carried out by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on the impacts of the Trading Online Voucher Scheme on small businesses that participated in the scheme. The scheme offers small businesses a grant of up to €2,500, as well as training, mentoring and networking support to help them develop their online trading capability. The Government want more small businesses trading online. A target of an additional 2,000 or more small business trading online by the end of 2015 has been set. 'We know that 67 per cent of all of the new jobs created in Ireland are created by start-ups in their first five years of business so it is essential that we do everything we can to support these business and to drive them into the future.' said Deputy Doyle. He continued: 'the Growing Small Business Through Online Trade report shows that over 70 per cent of small businesses that took part in the Government's Trading Online Voucher Scheme expect to recruit more staff. 'Small business is the cornerstone of a sustainable economy and these local businesses support thousands of jobs here in Wicklow. In Ireland, €700,000 is spent online every hour. That is a staggering statistic and we want Wicklow businesses to benefit from this trend. We want more Irish SMEs to win that business and the Trading Online Voucher Scheme offers a real opportunity for Irish retailers to increase sales and exports by marketing their goods and services more effectively.'
