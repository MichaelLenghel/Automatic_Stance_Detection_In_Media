THE UK's online advertising market has overtaken TV for the first time, but senior sources in Ireland said trends here were a long way behind those across the Irish Sea. New figures yesterday showed a record £1.75bn (€1.91m) was spent on online ads in the UK over the first half of the year, narrowly beating the £1.64bn spent on TV. The spends represented a 4.6pc year-on-year rise for online advertising and a 17pc year-on-year fall for TV. There are no recent figures for online spending in the Irish market, as industry figures struggle to agree a collection mechanism with data-crunchers Nielsen.  Growing Ciaran Cunningham, head of media buying agency Carat, yesterday said the market here said while online spends here are growing, it certainly hasn't surpassed TV. "We'd estimate that online has about 8pc of total spend with TV having about 20pc," he said. "Clients are looking to spend more on online than they did in previous years, but we're not seeing people spending more on online than on TV." The UK's TV marketing body, meanwhile, pointed out that the online figures included swathes of different areas, including email, search, classified and display ads. "It is meaningless to sweep all the money spent on every aspect of online marketing into one big figure and celebrate it," a spokesman said. Irish Independent
