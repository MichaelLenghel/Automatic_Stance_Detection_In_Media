Clothing retailer Zara will expand online sales to an additional 106 countries through a dedicated online platform, mostly in Africa, parent firm Inditex has said. The launch means Zara apparel will be available online in 202 countries. "From tomorrow, Zara's global women's, men's and kids collections will be available in a total of 202 markets, underpinned by the integrated store and online platform," the company said. Inditex has said it aims by 2020 to have all its brands, including Massimo Dutti and teen brand Bershka, available online worldwide. Zara customers in countries including Angola, Ivory Coast and Indonesia will be able to place orders in euro, including shipping costs and custom charges, the company said. Orders will be filled from the online platform in Spain. Online sales at Inditex jumped 41pc in 2017 to reach 10pc of group net sales, although this left it behind some rivals. Inditex is seeking to integrate online sales with its store network. Reuters
