THAT first trip to the bookie's was a rite of passage for many Irish males. I have to admit that I could never work out what the attraction was. Grotty shops with lino floors, pock-marked by cigarette burns. But it was the odour, a combination of stale cigarette smoke and fully ripe BO, which really sticks in the memory. That was then and this is now. As anyone who has been to a bookie's recently can readily testify, today's gambling parlours are positively palatial by comparison with the dingy betting shops of yesteryear. The lino has long since given way to clean carpets or fashionable hardwood flooring while, even before the smoking ban, air conditioning and improved personal hygiene had done wonders for the atmospheric quality. On a recent trip to the bookie's I was even offered coffee, for God's sake! Kitting out bookie's shops to such high standards doesn't come cheap. Last year quoted bookie Paddy Power spent over ?23m on its shops. As well as opening six new outlets in Ireland and 19 in the UK in 2004, Paddy Power also refitted 27 of its Irish shops, extended four and relocated another four. In other words, Paddy Power either opened, refitted, extended or relocated 41 of its 143 Irish betting shops last year. That's over 28 per cent of the total. While no one who remembers them will regret the passing of the grimy gambling dens of old, are the huge amounts being spent by Paddy Power and other rapidly expanding Irish bookies chains such as John Boyle's Boylesports and Ivan Yates' Celtic Bookmakers a complete waste of money? Last year, punters in Ireland and the UK wagered ?1.165bn with Paddy Power, an increase of over 27 per cent on the previous year's ?913m. The group enjoyed healthy turnover growth in all of its betting channels with retail gambling increasingby almost 25 per cent to ?688m, online betting up 29 per cent to ?240m and telephone betting up by a third to ?236m. As a result of the slightly faster growth in telephone and online gambling experienced by Paddy Power last year, retail gambling declined as slightly as a proportion of group turnover from 60 per cent in 2003 to 59 per cent in 2004. While the amount of money being wagered in Paddy Power's shops is still growing strongly, it's a different story when it comes to profits. Last year Paddy Power cranked out operating profits of ?17.7m from its betting shops, an increase of less than 2 per cent over 2003. When you take into consideration the fact that the number of Paddy Power shops in Ireland and the UK grew from 149 to 174 last year, an increase of almost 17 per cent, the extent of the relative underperformance of the group's shops, on which it spent ?23m over the past 12 months, becomes clear. What spared Paddy Power's blushes was the excellent performance of its online and telephone betting operations. Its online profits rose from ?1.37m to ?8.83m while telephone betting profits jumped from ?861,000 to ?4.55m. Between them, online and telephone betting contributed 43 per cent of Paddy Power's 2004 operating profits of ?31.1m, up from just 11 per cent in 2003. Online and telephone betting have many advantages for both bookies and punters. From Paddy Power's point of view the most important advantage is that it doesn't need an expensive chain of shops to collect the bets. The average amount of money wagered online or over the phone is also much higher. While the average retail bet was just ?18.21 last year, the average telephone bet was four-and-half times greater at ?83.01, while the average online bet was ?27.09. This combination of lower collection costs and higher average bet values means that Paddy Power can offer its online and telephone customers better odds than its retail punters. Last year Paddy Power's gross win, the total amount wagered by punters less winnings returned to them, was ?134.1m or 11.5 per cent of turnover. However, while the gross win margin in its shops was 12.88 per cent, it was 10.73 per cent for online bets and just 8.31 per cent for telephone bets. For Paddy Power online betting is particularly lucrative. Last year its online operating margin was a juicy 3.67 per cent as against 2.57 per cent for retail betting and 1.92 per cent for telephone betting. In other words, even when all of its costs have been paid, Paddy Power gets to keep ?1.10 more of every ?100 wagered online than if the money had been gambled in one of its shops. So is the end nigh for the local bookie's shop? Probably not just yet. The performance of Paddy Power's betting shops was depressed in 2004 by the losses suffered by its UK shops, of which there were 31 by year-end. Chief executive John O'Reilly is forecasting that the UK shops will break even this year and make a profit in 2006. This should result in a significant boost to the overall profitability of its betting shops next year. Still, I can't help but feel that the days when there was a couple of bookies on every main street of Ireland are numbered, and will remain so as ever more of us who feel like a flutter choose the phone or internet instead.
