Yesterday marked a successful day for Stripe when it secured a fresh funding round of €57m, valuing the online payments firm at €2.8bn. Launched by Limerick brothers John (24) and Patrick Collison (26) in 2010, the tech company has steadily risen in wealth and global recognition despite - or perhaps because of - their youth. In this vein, we've taken a look at their counterparts - those of similar age that look set to shape the face of business as we know it. From fashion to funds, politics to property and a mountain of applications for use in the cyber sphere, these are the leaders of our future. * Keyun Ruan (28) Cyber security Originally from Shanghai, Dublin-based and UCD-educated Ruan is one of the world's foremost experts on cybersecurity.

 Chupi at her kitchen table

  Chupi at her kitchen table / Chupi was recruited to design for Topshop at the tender age of 21 - the youngest designer it had ever hired- but it's jewellery rather than clothes which have made her a household name.  Celebrity fans include Marina Dimandis of Marina and the Diamonds, and Ruby Wax. The business is run from Dublin's trendy Portobello district. * Eric Risser (30) Animation software This Floridian isn't strictly Irish, but given the roots he has built up here we had to include him. His Dublin-based software business Artomatic, co-founded with Naas entrepreneur Neal O'Gorman, lets animators speed up the most laborious aspects of the design process for film and video games. The software was built by Risser himself from scratch. * Greg Kavanagh (29) Property Arklow's 29-year-old Greg Kavanagh is behind one of the biggest gambles of the crash and boom. His New Generation house-building group has been hoovering up prime development land around Dublin since the crisis days of 2011. Having packed up many of its sites for half nothing, Kavanagh and his team are sitting on truly stupendous profits. * Eoghan McCabe (28) Sales software An off-the-cuff email to billionaire Twitter founder Biz Stone led to Eoghan McCabe getting investment for his start-up Intercom, which makes software that helps companies manage and track their relationships with their customers. In January, Intercom raised €17m from investors - one of the largest fundraisings by an Irish tech company this year. * Ciaran Greenwood (21) Food supplements The Limerick-born entrepreneur left Blackrock College before his final exams to trade gold online. He used the proceeds to launch his business V12 Shots, a protein drink made in Ireland and sold in the UK, last year. In the company's short lifespan Greenwood has managed to secure a high-profile partnership with UK championship football club Wolves. * Daire Hickey (28) Event management, software While Paddy Cosgrave gets much of the brand recognition for the Web Summit, his two co-founders have contributed a lot to the creation of a company that is probably worth far more than the €35m figure ascribed to it in (rejected) acquisition rumours last month. The 28-year-old co-founder, Daire Hickey, is the media brains behind an organisation that leans heavily on media leverage to expand its influence. A former journalist in Dublin, Cork-born Hickey has an encyclopedic knowledge of US, European and Irish media organisations and how they operate. * Jules Coleman (29) Online cleaner finder
