New figures released this week in the 2010 IAB PwC Online Adspend Study have valued the online advertising market in Ireland at €110m up from €97m in 2009. This represents a 13.5pc increase in adspend year on year and surpasses industry predictions for the 2010 online market. Industry sources had predicted that online adspend in 2010 would reach €102m. The growth in the second half of 2010 at 15pc was higher that the 12.3pc growth recorded in the first half of the year over the same period in 2009. All online advertising formats saw increases in adspend, as growing numbers of advertisers embrace the online channel. Advertising on social media sites and ad networks contributed to the growth of display spend, which has grown from 26.6pc in 2009 to 31pc in 2010. Online classified advertising and paid-search advertising again showed strong performances representing 25pc and 44pc respectively of total adspend. The study also identifies the key spenders in the display and classified formats. Auto is the top performing category for 2010 at 21pc. In second place is the recruitment/property sectors combined at 17pc.
