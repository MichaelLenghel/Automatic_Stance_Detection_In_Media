Get your aviators ready and your beach volleyball skills maxed, because GTA takes a trip to the San Andreas Flight School! Let's hear it for the boys. Keeping up with their commitment to add new content to the online GTA world, Rockstar have rolled out a big one this time. Ten new solo missions, new vehicles, new equipments and new play modes all add up to a considerable update to keep fans happy.    As well as new races, captures and parachute jumps, the update adds three new missions modes. In case you lose that loving feeling for the air, you'll still have the delicious Invetero Coquette Classic to cruise around in, until you suit up again in your brand new flight suit.  The update is available now via the automatic update for both PS3 and Xbox 360 Online Editors
