Athletics - Lusk: Saturday morning will live long in the memory of those who were present at Newbridge House for the Fit4Life graduation day. Donabate parkrun was awash with a sea of white and blue as Lusk AC were out in force.  A massive 35 club members completed the 5k, of which 10 did so for the first time. Many other members also volunteered or were there to show there support for our fantastic new recruits. It was also great to see eight of our regular runners achieving PBs and five dipping under 21 minutes. Well done to all who attended and huge congratulations to our Fit4Life group, their mentors and coaches.  Congratulations to Nicole Hodson (4:15) and John McDonald (4:2) who ran the EOI Marathon in the Meath village of Longwood. The course was on a nice 5k loop and although both have run quicker marathons they were delighted to get this one under their respective belts, having had an injury-disrupted start to the year. On Sunday, the club were well represented by adult members in three different counties.  Nineteen travelled to Co Meath for the Dunboyne 4-mile race. It's a fast course that is loved by spectators and runners alike, with the course route taking the runners through Dunboyne village three times. It was a warm afternoon, but conditions were conducive for fast times and our athletes took full advantage.  Eamon Caffrey and Jamie Cruise led the Lusk men home with great times and Dara Ann Harford was first Lusk lady home again as our women had a real breakthrough performance, coming fifth in the club table. All the Lusk AC runners were roared on from the sidelines by their supporters.   Dwain Moore and Mark Condren made the long journey to Co Cork for the Mallow 10-mile race. For Mark it was great to be back on home turf, while Dwain continued to his impressive form with a three-minute PB. Hazel Keegan ran the half-marathon at the Wicklow Gaol Break in warm conditions and although slightly disappointed with her time she has set down a good marker for the season to come. This was fantastic running by all. Well done.  Results: Dunboyne 4 mile - Eamon Caffrey 25:22, Jamie Cruise 26:46, Dara Ann Harford 26:48, Richard Foy 27:22, Francis McCullagh 27:24, Colm McNally 28:00, Fiona Reinhardt 28:58, Kathy McNamara 29:37, Orla Smith 29:40, Annette Foy 29:45, Liam Halpin 30:52, Des McNally 31:09, Colin Browne 31:41, Eamonn Gahan 32:16, Eamon McBride 32:56, Catriona Skelly 35:21, Claire Ryan-Hogan 35:29, Geraldine Halpin 38:50, Geraldine McCartney 38:50.

The race is at 10am on Easter Monday and entries are still open. After a very busy first weekend at the Juvenile National Indoors Day 2 with five Lusk AC athletes competing, the club sent just one athlete to Day 3 of the Championships on Sunday.  Kirsty Seaton competes at U-15 level and has come so close to success over the last few years in her dream of becoming a National juvenile hurdles champion and anyone who has seen her race will agree that she is an extremely skilled hurdler, while also excelling in long jump and sprints. After winning gold in the Dublin Championships in February, Kirsty had high hopes for Sunday as she prepared for her 60m hurdles race at AIT Athlone, running in one of three heats in an age category which the commentators dubbed the most competitive out of all of the age groups in hurdles this year.  After getting into the blocks psyched up to go all out, there was a first false start, followed by an agonising wait until the athletes were asked to go to the blocks again. Then a second false start led to the athlete in Lane 1 being disqualified and another wait. On the third attempt the remaining hurdlers flew out of the blocks at a ferocious pace and Kirsty ran extremely well, keeping up in the front of the race and finishing in a very strong fourth position in a fast heat.  She can be very proud of her performance and she came very close to a place in the final. Well done Kirsty and best of luck in your long jump on April 7th.  Happy Easter to all of our juveniles and best of luck to those competing in Nationals on April 7th. We'll see you all back at training after the break.   BALLYBOUGHAL  Our Annual Club Poker Classic will take place this Thursday in The Oldtown House at 9.30pm and tickets are priced at €50. The men's first team beat St Anne's 1-19 to 2-9 in the league on Sunday morning at home. It was great to get the first win on the board for the year. The men's second lost to Garda by five points.  Best of luck to the Ladies team as they play their first league match this Wednesday night away to Garristown - time TBC.  Well done to the Ballyboughal Under-9 and Under-11 girls teams who kicked off their season with home matches last weekend.

Some of the moves that did produce an end product resulted in last year's Minor trio of Darragh Kelly, Fionn and Rian Moore-Fogarty combining well to claim a goal each.  Shane Clare and Luke Caul both made their adult football debuts.  Well done to our U-10 boys who travelled to Garristown and put on a gritty display of football in what proved to be a back and forth battle. St Pat's Donabate were hosted in glorious weather on Saturday and a very physical game of hurling ensued, sprinkled by moments of lovely pure hurling throughout. The coaches, parents and all involved are very proud.   The U-11 boys produced a great hurling performance, with Cuala missing a few players, well done to the RTL lads who played a half for them: Killian Brady, Owen Byrnes, Harry Cunningham, Euan McGrath and Sean O'Loughlin. Evan Ferguson was his usual deadly marksman from both play and frees. Euanie McKenna, Evan Whyte and Rubén Campbell also contributed to Towers' 4-16 haul, with Killian Brady scoring a nice goal for Cuala.  Larry Farrelly and Barra Doyle fought hard around the middle of the pitch to keep the ball supplied to the forwards, while Darragh Young in goals, with great support from defenders Sean O'Loughlin and Euan McGrath, kept the Cuala forwards at bay.  Well done to our U-15 boys on another hard-fought win against a physical Thomas Davis side in Gormanston on Sunday. The lads went two points down in the second half until a goal scrambled by Oran McKenna got us back on top. Well done to Evan Kelly whose kickouts have been outstanding since he went into goals. Evan also pulled off two impressive saves when the match was up for grabs in the second half. Also, Dan and Keelan worked tirelessly.  Well done to our U-15 girls on a great performance against Skerries Harps, winning 1-14 to 3-4. Our U-8 hurlers had an impressive win over St Brendans.
