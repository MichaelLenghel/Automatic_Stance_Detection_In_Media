The JNIR (Joint National Internet Research) was published today. Its findings reveal that 51% of Irish adults are now online and over half of all internet users have made at least one online purchase in the past month. The objective of the JNIR survey is to provide reliable estimates of audiences to Ireland’s key Internet sites, search engines, and email providers as a basis for the planning of advertising schedules. The JNIR research follows a largely traditional audience measurement research approach (JNLR,JNRR) and is contracted to Behaviour and Attitudes Ltd. It is comprised of the combination of offline and online research. The JNIR are creating a view that will be understandable and comparable with other media research. The research aims to profile people using different websites. However, its findings are limited because just 18 Irish Websites are included.
