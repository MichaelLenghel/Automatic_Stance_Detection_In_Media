THE Irish Medicines Board has ordered the recall of two US-manufactured herbal medicines following a warning  from Canadian and US health authorities. The medicines PC-SPES and SPES are marketed as "herbal dietary supplements" for "prostate health" and "strengthening the immune system". The IMB asked that all batches of the medicines, manufactured by BontanicLab in the US, be recalled after the Canadian medicines regulatory authority reported they contained prescription-only medicines. A report from the Californian Health Department shows that samples of PC-SPES and SPES were adulterated with the blood-thinning agent Warfarin, which can cause serious bleeding, and prescription-only Alprazolam, used to treat anxiety. The IMB is advising people taking either medicine to discontinue use and contact their doctor or the IMB.
