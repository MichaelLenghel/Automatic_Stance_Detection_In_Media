High-flying students with three A1s and three A2s are still finding it difficult, if not impossible, to get into medicine, despite extra places this year. Only TCD reports a slight easing on the second round but there is no change in the high entry standards required by the country's four other medical schools. A number of nursing courses as well as physiotherapy in two colleges dropped slightly but entry to several of the prestigious health related courses are still off-limits to many applicants and remain the preserve of those with a perfect or near perfect score in Leaving Certificate results. Medicine in TCD, which was unchanged from last year in Round One at 585* -- the asterisk means not everyone with these points gets an offer -- has gone down to 580*. But there was no comfort for those who applied for Medicine elsewhere, with no change at University College Dublin (UCD), 570*, NUI Galway (NUIG) 570*, University College Cork, (UCC) , 580 and the Royal College of Surgeons (RCSI), 570*. Dentistry at UCC has held at 555*, although Dental Science at TCD has fallen slightly, from 565 to 555*. There was no joy for applicants for Pharmacy at UCC, where the cut-off remains at 560*, but at RCSI the minimum requirement fell from 550* to 545*, and at TCD, there was a drop from 560* to 555*. Points cut-off for two Physiotherapy programmes remain the same, the University of Limerick, at 555*, and UCD, at 535, but there was a drop from 530* to 525* at TCD, while at RCSI it has gone from 525* to 525. There was no change in Occupational Therapy, with UCC making no offer and points at Trinity remaining at 505*, while NUIG also remained static at 515*. In speech and Language Therapy, UCC registered no change at 530, while at NUIG it has gone from 530* to 530, and TCD's Clinical Speech and Language Studies dropped 10 from 535* to 525*. There was no change in Radiography or Radiation Therapy, Veterinary Medicine or Optometry, while Human Nutrition and Dietetics at Dublin Institute of Technology fell from 540 to 525*. Two of TCD's three Level 7/6 dental programmes have dropped, Dental Hygiene, to 435 and Dental Technology to 325, while there were no second round offers in Dental Nursing, which was 335* on Round One. Overall there was a little easing of pressure for nursing applicants, although General Nursing at UCD, the biggest course in the country, held at 360, while its General and Integrated nursing went down five to 450*.
