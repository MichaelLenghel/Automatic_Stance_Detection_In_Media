LEAVING Certificate cut-off points for Medicine could rise to even more punishing levels this year as demand for entry to the highly-prized course jumps 15pc. New figures from the CAO, the centralised office for processing third-level applications, show that there are 2,256 first preferences (3.5pc) for medicine this year, up 312 on last year (2.9pc). With a Government-funded quota of 305 places in undergraduate medicine courses, it means that each place is being chased by more than seven applicants. A similar jump in demand of about 300 for Medicine between 2002 and 2003, led to an increase in minimum points levels from 555 to 570 - the equivalent of three A1s and three A2s. Any increase in cut-off points this year will push the minimum required for entry to medical schools even nearer the Leaving Certificate maximum score of 600. Other healthcare professional courses experiencing growing popularity include Pharmacy and applications continue to give cause for concern. The extra demand for Medicine this year is probably linked to a proposal from Education Minister Noel Dempsey to turn it into a post-graduate course from next Autumn - ironically to ease the points pressure. While no final decision has been taken, if the plan is implemented it means that this would be the last year for students to go straight into Medicine from school. Applicants who repeated the Leaving Certificate having failed to achieve the high points required last year are now facing even stiffer competition. According to the statistics issued by the CAO yesterday, there were 63,290 applicants for third-level this year, down from 65,794 last year, reflecting recent demographic trends. The overwhelming majority, 56,880 applied for a place on a degree course, while there were 46,592 applicants for diplomas/certificates programmes. Applicants may apply for both a degree and diploma. Arts and social science remains the most popular choice of candidates, attracting 22.6pc of first preferences, about the same as last year. Next comes administration/business, at 15.8pc, down slightly on 16pc in 2003. There was also a slight increase in first preference applications for science/applied science courses, up from 7.3pc to 7.6pc, although actual numbers are down from 4,848 to 4,823. for science/applied science. Demand for Education was down slightly to 6.8pc - 4,359 first preferences - while Law remained stable at 4pc, or 2,623 first preferences, as did Dentistry, with 231 first preferences. Pharmacy has seen a rise from 497 to 540 in the number of first preferences, while Physiotherapy is up from 1,007 to 1,064. Other Healthcare, which includes Nursing and Radiography, rose from 5,648 first preferences to 6,039. Veterinary Medicine also experienced an increase. At diploma/certificate level, administration/business remained the most popular choice. There were 17,810 first preference applications, followed by engineering/technology (9,992), arts/social science (6,566) and science/applied science (4,183). The results of the Leaving Certificate will be released on Wednesday, August 18, and the CAO offers will arrive on Monday, August 23.
