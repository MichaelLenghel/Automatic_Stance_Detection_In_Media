HEALTH spending has fallen dramatically here – but the amount spent on prescribed drugs remains far higher than many of our European neighbours. New figures from the OECD's latest 'Health at a Glance' report show Ireland's spend on health per capita fell by 6.6pc between 2009 and 2011, second only to major cutbacks in Greece. The fall in health spending is on the back of reforms in the sector, including cuts to health- sector wages and the prices paid to drugs companies for pharmaceuticals. Despite the cuts, however, our spending on pharmaceuticals remains well above the OECD average expenditure. The report blames this partly on a low use of generic medicines rather than branded medicines – with generic drugs accounting for only 18pc of all medicines prescribed in 2011. MEDICINES This compares with Germany, the UK, New Zealand and Denmark where generics account for more than 70pc of the market. There has been a drive towards generic medicines, with one of the heavily used drugs – statins for cholesterol – on a new list of branded and generic medicines to help drive down costs in the health sector. Life expectancy has increased by four years since 2000, with most people likely to reach over 80 years. Mortality rates due to cancer fell by a fifth, and one of the most common types of heart disease – ischemic heart disease – was down by 59pc between 1990 and 2011. OECD chiefs felt further progress could be made in reducing rates of cardivascular disease and cancer. Irish Independent
