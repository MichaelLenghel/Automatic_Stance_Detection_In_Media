Health Minister Mary Harney and the pharmaceutical manufacturers are patting themselves on the back for reducing the price of 30pc of the medicines on the Irish market. However, the taxpayer and the public are still paying over the odds for 70pc of our medicines. To make matters worse, 1.5 million medical card holders will soon have to pay up to €10 a month for their medicines, due to the new prescription levy. Also, the minister has hiked the threshold on the Drugs Payment Scheme by 20pc, so any person or family will now have to pay an extra €240 a year if their monthly medicines bill reaches this threshold. The majority of patients in this country will actually have to pay more for their medicines than they did last year.  Rory O'Donnell
