DRUG companies are set to scrap the practice of producing adult-tested medicines for children. New EU rules to come on stream in January aim to end the current system where more than half of children's medicines have only been tested on adults. Concerns were raised about the dosages and side effects of potent drugs given to children.Drug companies were previously reluctant to carry out drug trials on children for legal and other reasons.But the European Commission will now require medicines to be tested on children. Pharmaceutical companies will get concessions in return. They will be given six months more patent protection before the same medicine can be made in generic form. The new legislation is to cover drugs both in use and at development stage. Companies will have to give licensing authorities a "paediatric investigation plan" to show how their medicines can be prescribed for children. The regulation agreed will increase the supply of fully researched and authorised medicines developed specifically for children, said Martin Territ of the European Commission in Dublin. "I very much welcome this landmark agreement. This shows what Europe can do for its citizens. "A member state on its own cannot deliver such a policy which will benefit all children. "This regulation will improve the health of children by ensuring innovation in the development of medicines for their use." Mr Territ said a package of requirements, rewards and support measures would be put in place for the companies. "The regulation will increase high quality research, development and authorisation of medicines for children. It is being formalised in the coming days," he added.
