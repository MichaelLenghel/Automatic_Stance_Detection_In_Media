Inspectors have seized 650,000 dosage units of anabolic steroids, the body-building drugs, in the past three years alone. The illegal importation of the drugs - which can leave users at risk of serious harm - is now a growing concern. They accounted for 16pc of all illegally imported drugs seized last year, the annual report of the medicines watchdog, the Health Products Regulatory Authority, said. Inspectors held 619,213 dosage units of illegal medicines during the year. Illegal products detained included sedatives - which accounted for one-third of the illicit medicines - as well as anti-impotence tablets. The HPRA received 10,398 adverse reaction reports in relation to human medicines in 2018, a huge rise from 4,402 in 2017. The report said of the new adverse reaction reports received, some 252 patients were reported to have died while being treated. It said in many of the cases patients had significant underlying illness and were treated with multiple medicines, or had surgery which would also have contributed to the outcome. "In addition, many of these were influenced by disease progression and other complications unrelated to the medicine," the report added. "The majority were associated with medicines subject to close monitoring, those used in the management of severe underlying medical conditions, inpatient support programmes and special monitoring programmes. In the area of veterinary medicines, there were 394 suspected adverse reactions and events reported during the year." The HPRA said that it welcomed the commitment to reporting as the information received contributed significantly to the ongoing monitoring of the safety of medicines. Irish Independent
