A CRACKDOWN on products ``masquerading as medicines'' which promise to cure, alleviate or prevent disease was announced yesterday to protect public health. The Irish Medicines Board, the authority which licenses drugs, said for the first time inspectors are to be recruited to police the regulations requiring companies marketing medicinal products to prove the claims. ``We will require all companies marketing medicinal products to furnish us with the appropriate data on the product and apply for a product authorisation,'' said chief executive Dr Frank Hallinan yesterday. Herbal remedies, slimming products, vitamins, amino acids, certain foods and cosmetics will be subject to honest claims which cannot overstate their benefits. If they fail to meet the standard they will no longer be able to promote the product using descriptions such as ``cures, heals, treats, calms or helps maintain water balance.'' ``We will also be taking into account the packaging, the pharmaceutical form, the promotional material and the intended audience when determining the medicinal status of each product,'' he added, launching the new Guide to the Definition of a Medicinal Product. He said vitamins will be considered ``medicinal products'' when their labelling or literature makes any preventative, curative or remedial claim. It will also have to have a licence when the recommended daily intake of the vitamins or minerals exceeds the dose regarded as safest.  Mr Hallinan said the new procedure is unlikely to instigate an inspection of stores but instead act when a member of public brings a product to its attention.
