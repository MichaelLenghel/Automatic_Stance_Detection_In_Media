Patients in the UK are four times more likely to use a generic medicine than Irish people who are still reluctant to switch from branded versions. A generic medicine is the equivalent of a branded medicine and can be marketed once the exclusive licence for a particular drug has run out. Generics are cheaper than branded drugs – although the prices are still higher in Ireland than in the UK. However, we will be hearing much more about generics in the coming months when new legislation comes into force. It will put more onus on doctors to prescribe the most cost-effective drugs and there will be much more information for the public on generics in a bid to break down their suspicions. Former 'Late Late Show' host Gay Byrne is appearing on YouTube as part of a campaign by Teva Pharmacueticals, makers of generic drugs, to educate the public about them. Gay can be seen on a video at http://bit.ly/hlgenerics, where he directs people to the website understandgenerics.ie. Pharmacists are three times more likely to recommend generic medicines than doctors and 400 pharmacies are backing the campaign. Gay commented: "Through understandgenerics.ie, I learned that generics are approved in exactly the same way as all other medicines, guaranteeing that generics meet the required safety and quality standards."
