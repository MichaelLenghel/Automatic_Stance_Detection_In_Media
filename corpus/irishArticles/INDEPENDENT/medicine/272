GPs and hospital doctors who are administering a medical abortion will have the freedom to decide whether to give a woman medicines on site in their surgery or clinic or allow her take them at home. The Health Products Regulatory Authority, the medicines' watchdog, said it would not be imposing any rules in how the medical abortion was managed. A spokeswoman said the management of a medical abortion was a matter for the clinical setting rather than the licensing. The issue is expected to form part of the discussions with doctors' groups in the coming weeks as clinical guidelines on the Health Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy Bill are worked out. The proposed legislation is due to come before the Dáil next week. Meetings are planned next week with the Irish College of General Practitioners and other doctors' organisations. There are two medicines involved in a medical abortion, Mifepristone, which is taken first, and Misoprostol, which is administered 48 hours later. It was recently agreed in England that a woman would be allowed to take the medicines at home. About 80pc of the abortions carried out here are expected to be medical abortions. They will be legal up to 12 weeks of pregnancy. A phone line is expected to be set up here that a woman can ring and get advice if she feels unwell or develops complications. The annual March for Choice, organised by the Abortion Rights Campaign, will take place in Dublin today. A spokeswoman said thousands will turn out to mark repeal of the Eighth. Irish Independent
