IRISH people buying medicine over the internet have no way of verifying what they contain, it was claimed yesterday. Irish pharmacists are now calling for a national campaign to alert the public to the dangers of buying medicine online. Michael Guckian, president of the Irish Pharmaceutical Union which represents 1,600 pharmacists across the country, said it was seeking a national campaign after a patient in Sunderland in the north east of England went blind after taking steroids she purchased from a website operated from Thailand. "People will continue to buy medicines online unless the dangers are communicated to them in a public awareness campaign," he said. "They have no idea what the medicines contain and they are putting their lives and the lives of their family at risk by taking them." The Irish Medicines Board has already contributed to the closing down of 12 illegal on-line websites which sold medicines. Nine were based abroad and three were in Ireland.
