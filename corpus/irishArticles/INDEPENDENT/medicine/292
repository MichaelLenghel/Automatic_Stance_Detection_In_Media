The Medical School at NUI Galway has been allocated additional places on its flagship undergraduate medical programme. Students applying to study medicine for a September 2011 start, will see an extra 19 places made available, bringing the total number of medicine places at NUI Galway to 118. This will make it the second largest Medical School for undergraduate Irish and EU students in the country. Galway will provide places in medicine at undergraduate level only while its strategic partner, the University of Limerick, will concentrate on providing graduate medicine opportunities for those with a primary degree who are interested in studying medicine. NUI Galway president Dr James J Browne said the cooperation would result in an expansion of provision of top class medical education in the west and mid-west. Irish Independent
