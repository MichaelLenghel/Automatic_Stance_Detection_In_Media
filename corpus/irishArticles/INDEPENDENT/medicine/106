DO you keep your medicines safe in warm weather? We tend to be careless with tablets, particularly when travelling. Keep your medicines in the packaging they came in. Store your medicines according to the manufacturer's, or your pharmacist's, instructions. A leaflet written by the manufacturer will give you advice on how to store them. Medicines need to be kept out of direct sunlight, and away from heat and moisture. Don't assume that you can keep a medicine, that would normally be kept at room temperature, in a refrigerator. Taking steps to keep your house cool will also help keep your medicines protected. At times it may get very hot during summer but temperatures during a lot of the day are often 25C or below, so suitable for most medicines. Bathroom and kitchen cupboards can become warm and quite humid, and these conditions are tough on many medicines. Consider keeping your medicines in another, cooler room instead — but always out of the reach of children and pets. Try not to leave any medicines in your car. If it is hot outside then your car's glove box or boot is likely to get very hot. Changes in the appearance of your medicine, such as tablets and capsules crumbling or changing colour, becoming softer than usual, or sticking together, means they are probably damaged.
