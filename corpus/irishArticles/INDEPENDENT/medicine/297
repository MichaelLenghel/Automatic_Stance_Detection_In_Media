PHARMACISTS last night lashed out at what they claim is a life-threatening trend of "self-diagnosis" which encourages people to buy defective medicine off the internet. Following action by the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) last year, over a dozen websites selling prescription-only medicines were closed down. It also tracked the senders of 84 spam emails advertising prescription-only medicine. Despite the IMB's efforts, Pamela Cogan of the Irish Pharmaceutical Organisation said she believed the public were still buying medicines online. "It's a huge market out there; with the internet, people don't have to buy from Ireland," she said. "People are bombarded with emails and spam everyday telling them where they can get medicine from around the world." Consumers went online for medicines to eradicate a problem quickly, believing drugs were the only option, Ms Cogan added. "People decide they have a condition like depression and take medication that could be life threatening. "There is also a belief the online option is cheaper, but what price do you put on your health?"
