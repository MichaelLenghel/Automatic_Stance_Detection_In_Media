OVER-the-counter medicine to treat colds and flu can cost up to 60pc more depending on where you shop. A survey by the Irish Independent of major pharmacy and supermarket chains found huge variation in the prices charged for popular non-prescription medicines and ointments. The biggest price variation found was for Lemsip Cold & Flu, with a five-sachet pack costing €4.99 in Boots - which was 61pc more than in Tesco or SuperValu, where it retailed at just €3.09. But it wasn't only supermarkets that were cheaper, as the same Lemsip pack cost €4.10 in Lloyds Pharmacy. For Sudocrem baby ointment, Boots charges €4.99 for a 125g tub, which is 25pc more than Tesco where it costs €3.99. The same product cost just €3.15 (stg£2.50) at Boots.com in the UK. The price of generic paracetamol painkillers varied by about 12pc in the Republic with Boots and Lloyds pharmacy chains charging €2.49 for a 24-pack, while Hickeys charged €2.89. This was more than twice the UK price where you would pay €1.20 (stg£0.95) for a larger 32-tablet pack at Boots.com or 62c (49p) for a 16-pack. Nurofen painkillers also cost much less up North, with a price tag of €3.64 (stg£2.89) for 24 tablets compared with €5.69 in Hickeys Pharmacy. That means a single Nurofen tablet costs up to 24c in the Republic compared with just 15c in the North. For Nurofen Plus, a 32-tablet pack costs €9 in Boots UK, which is less than the price tag for a 24-tablet pack in many Irish pharmacies. For Nurofen Express standard heat patches, there was a 30pc price variation with Hickeys charging €6.51 compared with €4.99 in Boots. However, for the large size patches, Tesco was the most expensive, charging €6.99 or 9pc more than a nearby Boots outlet. While the price of prescription medicine in the Republic comes in for a lot of criticism, in fact consumers spend far more on over-the-counter medications. The most recent Central Statistics Office figures on spending indicate that the average household in Ireland spends more than €5 a week on over-the-counter medicine. Budget This is compared with less than €2 a week on prescription drugs and €3 a week on doctors' fees. That adds up to over €260 a year for non-prescription medicines, meaning big price variations can eat into the family budget. Rural households spend almost €6 a week - or €300 a year - on over-the-counter medicines. This could reflect the fact they have less access to price competition from different retail outlets. Neither Boots nor Hickeys pharmacy chains responded to requests for a comment. Supermarkets are restricted in the size and type of medicines they can sell. Sales of certain products such as Nurofen Plus or larger packets of painkillers are not permitted on patient safety grounds. Irish Independent
