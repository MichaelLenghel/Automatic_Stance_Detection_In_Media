Graduate applicants to medicine will know that the GAMSAT Ireland 2013 test takes place next Saturday, March 23.  CAO's application statistics for 2013 showed that slightly fewer students applied to medicine so far this year; the total numbers of applicants, whether school leavers or graduates, who listed it as their first preference were down from 3,719 in 2012 to 3,481 this year. One cannot be certain why this is the case, but it may have something to do with the fact that applicants to medicine must sit the HPAT (or GAMSAT) tests, and pay fees for these exams. This concentrates the mind of applicants, who might otherwise have applied to medicine on the off-chance that their exam results would be good enough on their own. The test fees (¿115 for the HPAT and ¿310 for GAMSAT) may also discourage students of more limited financial means from applying to medicine. Q What is the difference between the GAMSAT and the HPAT? A Standard school leaving applicants to undergraduate medicine sit the HPAT-Ireland (Health Professionals Admission Test), and its score is used in combination with school leaving examination results. The HPAT Ireland 2013 test took place on March 2. GAMSAT-Ireland is used as a selection procedure for graduates of any discipline who are applying to medicine via the graduate entry route in the four medical schools which offer the course, UCD, RCSI, UCC and UL. GAMSAT is also used for selection for graduate entry to veterinary medicine in UCD. Online Editors
