Over a fifth of people get prescription-only medicines from unregulated sources such as the internet, from friends or on holiday, new research had revealed. Of that number, more than a third were logging online to get their pills despite up to 90% of products on the web being fake. A study by pharmaceutical giant Pfizer found the Irish counterfeit medicines market was worth 86 million euro (£75 million), ranking the country the sixth worst in Europe for black-market drugs activity. The Irish Patients Association (IPA) warned more needs to be done to expose the dangers of buying unregulated medicines as many are unaware of the perils of purchasing online. Stephen McMahon, IPA chief, said: We need to do more as the fuse on this major public health time bomb ignites - many people don't realise the very real dangers of buying medicines online and that one click of the mouse could kill." The main reasons people shop online for their pills are time and money, with a massive 70% believing they will save cash. Research has shown counterfeit medicines can contain harmful ingredients such as rat poison, boric acid and lead paint. They are often produced by people with no appropriate qualifications and can include too much, too little or none of the required active ingredient. According to the Cracking Counterfeit Europe research, which surveyed 1,000 people, 21% of people are buying prescription medicine from unregulated sources and 36% of those do so from the internet while 16% get pills from friends and 12% buy them while on holiday.
