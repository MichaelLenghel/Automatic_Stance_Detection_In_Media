Dr. Pasang Tsering, is a doctor of Tibetan Medicine and was born in Tibet where he studied Tibetan Medicine in the Capital, Lhasa for one year. Tibetan Medicine is based on herbs collected primarily from the Himalyan region with pulse analysis central to diagnosis. Due to lack of Freedom in Tibet because of the Chinese Government's oppression there, Pasang decided to leave. In 1992, like many others he made the trip by foot across the Himalyan mountains to seek freedom in India. He continued studying Tibetan Medicine in Men Tsee Khang, the official College for studying Tibetan Medicine set up under the supervision of the Dalai Lama in 1960, in Dharamsala in Northern India. After five years he became fully qualified and began practising in Calcutta. After one year there, he moved to Morgyeling Tibetan Settlement in Maharashtra in India. It is the smallest and one of the poorest Tibetan camps in India and has been working there since. He also travels weekly to various surrounding Indian cities to meet with the enormous demand for Tibetan medicine. He was invited by Jampa Ling Tibetan Buddist Centre in Co. Cavan to come to Ireland to give talks on Tibetan medicine. He will be in Sligo on Saturday, November 23rd in the Silver Swan at 11.30. He will give a talk on the history of Tibetan medicine. He will then be available all day for one to one consultation. Unfortunately, his visa runs out at the beginning of December, so this will be the only occasion he will visit Sligo. He will be returning to the Tibetan Refugee Camp on December 3rd, so all proceeds from the day will go directly to Tibetan refugees. For further information telephone (049) 9523448.
