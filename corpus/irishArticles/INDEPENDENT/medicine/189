THE recent review of the veterinary medicines legalisation is one of the most controversial issues in the animal health area. This review will bring Ireland in line with the impending EU legalisation on animal medicines, which has recently undergone a significant review process. As a result of the new legalisation, farmers will no longer be able to purchase veterinary medicines, including intramammaries, over the counter. Products such as mastitis tubes will require a prescription but there will not be a requirement for a veterinary practitioner to examine the animals before giving the prescription. The review will also provide a wider availability of certain veterinary products through licensed merchants including co-ops. However, exceptions will apply, such as injectable antibiotics and sedatives. At the same time, it is intended to retain the requirement for a bona fide relationship between practitioner and client as the context within which prescriptions will be issued. In the future, veterinary practitioners must in all cases issue written prescriptions. If the vet supplies the medicine then a separate invoice must be issued. The Irish Medicines Board (IMB) is now designated as competent authority for veterinary vaccines, in addition to its existing role for other medicines. The Minister for Agriculture and Food will continue to exercise control on the use of vaccines for certain diseases. Amendment of the 1996 Regulations to remove the exception for intramammaries from the general rules on antibiotics and also to decouple intramammaries from controls under Poisons legislation are proposed. The new rules on animal medicines have been welcomed and rejected in equal measures by both farmers and the industry. Veterinary Ireland president Peadar Ó Scanaill puts forward the vet's case.
