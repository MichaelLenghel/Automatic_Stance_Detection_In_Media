Biogen Idec, one of Elan's research partners, told investors and analysts yesterday that it has 20 new medicines in advanced human trials, including treatments for multiple sclerosis, cancer and Parkinson's disease. At least six of the new medicines have reached the final tests generally required for US marketing clearance, the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotechnology company said yesterday in a statement. Biogen discussed new medicines it is developing at a meeting in Boston on Tuesday. It's fastest growing product, MS drug Tysabri which it co-develops with Elan, produces worldwide sales of $813m for the two companies. The company will have two MS medicines in late-stage trials by the end of this year, including a new version of its top-selling Avonex drug and a pill, called BG-12. Avonex, an injectable medicine, generated $2.2bn last year, accounting for more than half of Biogen's $4.1bn in revenue. "Looking out longer term, we still think Biogen has the best franchise in MS," said Geoffrey Meacham, an analyst with JP Morgan Securities in New York. Biogen now has more than 60 drug programmes in development covering 15 indications.
