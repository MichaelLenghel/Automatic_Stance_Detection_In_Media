THE CAO second round offers bring some comfort to students chasing highly-prized places on healthcare courses, writes Katherine Donnelly. Despite the huge demand for prestigious programmes, such as Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmacy, not all places were snapped up in the first round. A number of offers are being made in the second round and, in some cases, the points threshold has dropped. In a general comment on the second round, a CAO spokesman said that if the points are the same as in Round One, in the great majority of courses, only a few of offers were made. However, there is little joy for those hoping for a second round offer in nursing, with only a handful of the 34 degree programmes in universities and institutes of technology offering a place in the second round. This was the first year that nursing was fully integrated into the CAO process and it appears to have worked well, with the first round points thresholds of 340-390 accurately hitting the mark. The uptake in Round One underlines a strong commitment to the profession from those who list nursing as a choice on the CAO form. Although most nursing places are gone, Trinity College, Dublin is advertising vacancies on its Psychiatric Nursing course while Dundalk Institute of Technology has vacant places in Mental Handicap Nursing. These arise where there were insufficient numbers of qualified applicants applying for these courses. The picture is more varied in the wider healthcare area. In University College Dublin, the points for Medicine are down from 570 (random) - meaning not all students with 570 received an offer - to 565 (r). There has been a similar fall in the threshold for Medicine at NUI Galway, where the cut-off also dropped from 570 (r) to 565 (r). University College Cork is also making offers in the second round but its point threshold remains unchanged at 565 (r). However, Trinity College, where the round one cut off was 570 (r) has made no second round offer. While the Royal College of Surgeons is making no offer for Medicine, which was 570 (r), its Medicine with a Leaving Cert Scholarship, has dropped from 590 (r) to 590. It is also offering Pharmacy with unchanged points, 540 (r). UCC is making offers in Dentistry and Pharmacy (points unchanged), Occupational Therapy, down from 500 to 490, and Speech and Language Therapy, down from 520 to 515. In Trinity, Dental Science has dropped from 565 to 555 (r) while Occupational Therapy is down 15 to 490 (r) from 505 (r) and Pharmacy has gone to 545 (r) from 550. As well as Medicine, UCD has made offers in Radiography and Veterinary Medicine, where the points are unchanged, and in Physiotherapy, there the threshold has dropped to 530 (r) from 535 (r). NUI Galway is offering Speech and Language Therapy, unchanged, at 510 (r).
