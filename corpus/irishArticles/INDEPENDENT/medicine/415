THE first move to force doctors and pharmacists to give patients cheaper drugs will be made this week as a list of medicines, which are equally effective in reducing cholesterol, is announced. It should also see prices of the generic versions of these drugs, known as statins, fall by 20pc. Interchangeable medicines contain the same active ingredient with the same strength but can differ in price. Doctors should prescribe the cheapest of these to the patient. MEDICINES The statins are the first group of drugs to be part of a list, and they will be followed by 19 other of the most widely used medicines here. The background work has been done by the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) and follows the legislation passed earlier this summer aimed at promoting more prescribing of generic drugs in a attempt to bring down the State's bill. The gross savings arising from the deal on branded and generic medicines will be in excess of €400m over three years. Irish Independent
