A TOTAL of 59 charges against three defendants in relation to the sale or supply of medicinal products were struck out after the Irish Medicines Board - the body bringing the case - failed to appear at Tralee District Court. Both Lyntondell Ltd, trading as Daly Nutritionals, Foynes, Co Limerick and Paschal Carmody of Ballycuggeran, Killaloe, Co Clare faced a total of 25 prosecutions each at Bawnboy, Ballyroe, Tralee, relating to the supply of medicinal products to shops, a pharmacy and two doctors without being granted a wholesaler's licence by the IMB on various dates between December 11 2003 and November 3, 2004. Nine further charges were brought by the Irish Medicines Board. These were against Seamus Kane, Bawnboy, Ballyroe. In a statement yesterday, the Irish Medicines Board said neither the board nor its legal team were aware that the matter was for hearing by the court yesterday.
