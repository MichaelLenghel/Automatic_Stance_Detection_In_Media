SLIMMERS were warned yesterday to avoid potentially dangerous and illegal traditional Chinese medicines on sale in the UK. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said it had become aware of the slimming aids being available on the market in Britain and elsewhere. It is believed one traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) product, called Shubao Slimming Capsules, was responsible for a case of irreversible liver failure in the UK. The MHRA said caution should be exercised when considering using a TCM slimming aid to help weight loss. The agency added that the safety, quality and efficacy of these unlicensed medicines could not be assured due to the possible illegal adulteration or contamination with pharmaceutical drugs or toxic herbal ingredients. A number of dangerous TCM weight loss remedies have been discovered on the UK and international markets. An MHRA spokesman said: "We recognise many consumers value traditional Chinese medicines but they should be aware we continue to find products manufactured to low quality standards which contain potentially harmful substances. Many of these products are promoted as natural and safe and hazardous ingredients may not be declared on the label." The MHRA said some TCM slimming aids have been found to contain sibutramine - a prescription-only medicine which should only be used under medical supervision as it may raise blood pressure. Other substances of concern include Aristolochia, Qing zhisan tain shou, Li Da Dai Dai Hua, Meizitang, Xiao Pang Mei or New Reducing Medicine, Shubaojianfeijiaolang and Jingzhi Kesou Tanchuan.
