ANABOLIC steroids, prescription level vitamins and herbal products were among the products recalled by the Irish Medicines Board last year. The annual report of the board showed during 2004 there were 270,598 tablets, 506,005 capsules and 10.552 litres of liquids as well as 39 kgs of creams recalled. Its enforcement unit initiated 314 cases involving breaches of medicinal product regulation. There were 198 offences for the illegal import of medicinal products, with just under half relating to advertising prescription only medicinal products while the remainder related to making medicinal claims.
