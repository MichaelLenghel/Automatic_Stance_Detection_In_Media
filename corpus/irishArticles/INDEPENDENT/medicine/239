One in four people admit they don't read the information that comes with their medicine and one in eight said they have taken a prescription medicine not prescribed for them.  The findings have emerged as part of a  national public information campaign to raise awareness of the safe and effective use of medicines. The medicines watchdog, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), warned people should take the time to read the information printed on the packaging and/or the product leaflet.  Lorraine Nolan, chief executive of the HPRA, said it is important people take the time to better inform themselves about their medication. "Medicines can help us to live longer and healthier lives, but for the safest and most beneficial outcome, people need to inform themselves about the correct dose, the directions for use and the known side effects. "Our research tells us that people who read this information spend about three minutes doing so. Our campaign aims to encourage more people to always take those three minutes whether they are taking medication themselves or giving it to someone in their care.  "If people have any questions or concerns, they should always consult their doctor or pharmacist." She said it applied even if someone is taking a specific medicine regularly over a long period of time. Health & Living
