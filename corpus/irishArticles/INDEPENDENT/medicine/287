Parents are urged to avoid using household teaspoons to give children medicine as sizes can vary widely, leading to both under and overdoses. A study in the International Journal of Clinical Practice looked at more than 70 teaspoons collected from 25 homes. They found the largest was three times the size of the smallest and that people poured in varying quantities of medicine. To avoid dosage differences, the team urged parents to use syringes, which are increasingly given out with over-the-counter medicines such as child paracetamol and ibuprofen. The risks of harm occurring as a result of parents giving too much of these products in a single dose is thought to be very small. Pharmacists increasingly recommend that parents and carers only use spoons or syringes which are designed for the administration of medicines if they are giving liquid medicines to children.
