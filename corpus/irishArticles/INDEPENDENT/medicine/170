SO, according to the Irish Medicines Board (IMB), the 64,000 people who annually buy medicines on the internet are taking a risk with their health ('Thousands buy medicines online despite warnings', Irish Independent, April 7). Why, because the medicines regulator's CEO, Mr Pat O'Mahony, warns that the medicines may be counterfeit and contain no active ingredients. Is this the same Pat O'Mahony, CEO of the IMB, who has failed to regulate the active medicinal substance fluorosilicic acid, the one that is added daily to the drinking water of some three million people here, despite our direct appeal to him to do so? Not only has the same active substance to supposedly prevent dental decay never been medically licensed anywhere, but the risk assessment of this same industrial waste fluoride that was promised to us within six months by the World Health Organisation at the 2003 Drinking Water Seminar in Brussels is still outstanding! Is ignoring the most widely consumed counterfeit medicine in Ireland just another example of light-touch regulation?  Robert Pocock  Voice of Irish Concern for the Environment  DUBLIN 2
