The warning comes as the Irish Pharmaceutical Union calls for an expansion of the ‘Dump Unwanted Medicines Properly’ (DUMP) scheme — currently in use in the south west — which encourages people to dispose of their unused medicines at their local pharmacy. Impressed by the success of the scheme here, the Irish Pharmaceutical Union called on the Health Service Executive to roll out the DUMP campaign nationwide. Tralee pharmacist, Peter Harty says that disposing of old and unwanted medicines in a safe manner is extremely important. “I would advise people to dispose of any unwanted medicines they have in their homes by brining them into the pharmacy,” he said. “Paracetamol, ibuprofen or aspirin are common causes of accidental poisoning in children and even though these medicines can be obtained without a doctor's prescription, they are still very dangerous, if taken incorrectly.” The South Western Area Health Board has been running a DUMP Campaign since January 2004 and has collected 13.5 tonnes of medicines to date. The HSE Dublin/Mid-Leinster and HSE Midlands and Southern Areas have recently undertaken to fund DUMP campaigns through community pharmacies to return out of date or unused medicines. It is hoped, however, that the scheme will soon be available nationwide
