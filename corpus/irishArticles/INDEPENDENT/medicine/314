the UK is asking logistics providers to bid for a £25m (€27.2m) express freight contract to deliver medicines into the country on a daily basis after it has left the European Union on October 31. The UK Department for Health said the contract would form part of its contingency plans to deal with any complications. The service is intended to deliver small parcels of medicines or medical products on a 24-hour basis, with larger pallets carrying goods on a two-to-four day basis. "I want to ensure that when we leave the EU at the end of October, all appropriate steps have been taken to ensure frontline services are fully prepared," UK Health Minister Chris Skidmore said. The contract will run for 12 months, with a possible further 12-month extension.  The department has already sought to help companies build up buffer stocks of  medicines and procured extra warehouse space. The British government was embarrassed earlier this year after it signed a £14m contract with a company to provide extra ferries in the event of a no-deal Brexit, even though the company did not have any ships. It later scrapped that contract. Irish Independent
