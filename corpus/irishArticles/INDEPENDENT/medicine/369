THE breathless race for a place in Medicine has pushed the cut-off points in one course to a record 600, the maximum available under the CAO college entry scoring system, writes Katherine Donnelly. The inexorable rise in the points is evident in all colleges, with the exception of NUI Galway, where it remained the same as last year at 570*, meaning not everyone with those points will get an offer. With only one extra first preference application to the CAO this year for Medicine, from 2256 to 2257, the new highs underline the fierce competition among students, who are striving ever harder for results that will ensure them a place, and pushing the points up in the process. Other high demand health care courses such as Pharmacy, Dentistry, Occupational Therapy, Physiotherapy, and Radiography also continue to command high points. While not all healthcare courses have seen a points rise, and some have dipped slightly from last year, there has been a general points inflation in this area. In Veterinary Medicine, where there was a 13pc drop in first preference applications this year, there was slight easing of points to 555* from 560. At the top end, all eight entrants to the Royal College Surgeons (RCSI) medicine programme through the Leaving Certificate scholarship route achieved the maximum 600, up from a cut off of 590* last year. Other Medicine courses would also have attracted students who achieved 600 points, but the greater number of offers made elsewhere would have brought the cut-off level down. The next highest points cut off, 590*, is at TCD, up from 585* last year. The upward climb is also evident at the other end of the healthcare scale, where in excess of 500 points is needed for entry to 23 of 24 healthcare courses. Among the group, the lowest points cut-off this year is 500 (Radiography at UCD down from 510 last year) up from 495* for the same course last year. There is some comfort for applicants to the Level 7 Dental Hygiene and Dental Technology courses and the Level 6 Dental Nursing course , all in TCD, where the points cut off have dropped this year. Dental Nursing is down 85 to 380, Dental Hygiene is down 20* to 500 and Dental Technology has fallen by 65* to 400. There has also been a sweeping surge in cut off points for general nursing, which saw a substantial increase in demand for places this year, bringing the number of first preference applications up to 5,029. The highest points cut off is for general nursing at NUI Galway, at 415*, up five from 410* in 2004, and the University of Limerick (415*, up from 405*), while at University College Cork, the threshold is 415, up from 400* in 2004. The picture is more mixed for psychiatric and intellectual disability nursing, with points up in some cases, including a 60 point hike to 385 for Intellectual Disability Nursing in Waterford, and down in others. At Galway-Mayo IT both General Nursing and Psychiatric Nursing are down, the former by by 30 points to 370 and the latter by 45 to 330, the biggest single drop in nursing.
