SOME of the country's top Leaving Certificate students have missed out on their preferred college choice for this year, because their exam papers were incorrectly marked. Many applicants for medicine and other prestigious programmes have been told they must wait another year to take up their place. The students have become entitled to places two months after the original offers were made, after successfully appealing results. The results of the Leaving Certificate appeals were released this week, with over 2,000 upgrades. In many cases, the improved grades boosted the students' points score to a level where they became entitled to a place that eluded them in August. The scale of late offers to students has caused problems. The CAO is making 339 new college offers today to the class of 2010, as a result of the outcome of the appeals process. The upgrades posed major problems for the Royal College of Surgeons, with a total of 18 students becoming eligible for places on its medicine, physiotherapy and pharmacy programmes, instead of the more usual three to six. The college is trying to accommodate some of the five additional students into medicine this year, but it cannot cater for the seven new students for pharmacy or the six for physiotherapy.  Deferred Trinity College, Dublin, is making an additional offer for both medicine and dental science for this year. However, of the nine additional students for pharmacy, only seven can be accommodated. Two have been offered deferred places. University College, Dublin, is offering two new students a place in medicine this year. University College, Cork, can accommodate all new offers being made this year, except those for medicine, where there are three, which are being deferred. Irish Independent
