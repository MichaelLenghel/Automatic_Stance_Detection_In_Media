Irish pharmacists have warned of the huge dangers associated with mixing high volumes of alcohol with medication throughout the Christmas period. Even moderate drinking as the potential to interfere with hundreds of Ireland’s most commonly used medications, including over the counter and herbal remedies.  Pharmacist Daragh Connolly, Vice-President of the Irish Pharmacy Union (IPU) said: “Although most medicines are safe and effective when used as directed, mixing alcohol and medicines puts you at risk of a dangerous reaction.   “Our advice is if you are taking any medication, ask your pharmacist for advice before consuming alcohol to make sure it is safe to mix the two.” Christmas tipples have the potential to make some medications less effective can intensify side effects such as sleepiness, drowsiness and light headedness. Mixing alcohol and medication can also affect concentration levels and the ability to operate machinery or drive a vehicle.  The IPU have also warned drivers that mixing medication with just one drink could interfere with blood alcohol concentration levels, pushing them over the legal limit.  “We also need to remember that medicines containing alcohol can affect a person’s blood alcohol concentration Limits so, by drinking alcohol on top of taking medication, you could unconsciously put yourself over the legal limit for driving,” said Connolly. “Our advice is to always read the label and, when in doubt, ask your pharmacist.”  Online Editors
