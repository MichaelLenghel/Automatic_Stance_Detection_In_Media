Clodagh Sheehy A DRUG used to prevent blood clots has been urgently recalled by the Irish Medicines Board because some doses could be up to 50pc stronger than the label suggests. The Board has warned patients not to use doses from the affected batch "under any circumstances" and to contact their doctor as soon as possible for advice on what to do. It has told pharmacies, patients and hospitals that Batch 28043 of the drug Clexane "may have severe adverse consequences for patients". Clexane is produced by Sanofi Aventis, one of the biggest pharmaceutical firms in the world. The prescription-only medicine is used to prevent clots in patients with heart disease and illnesses such as kidney failure, as well as those who have been bed-ridden for a long time. The Medicines Board said the particular batch has been sent to 46 hospital and 12 retail pharmacies around the country and it estimates that about 500 patients may have been treated with it. It requests that all unused units of the batch should be quarantined. The Irish Medicines Board is also asking all hospitals and pharmacies to identify patients to whom to the product may have been given to advise them not to use it and to return it immediately. Dr Jerome D'Enfert of Sanofi Aventis said the recall was a "precautionary measure" after the problem came to light during quality testing. He added that 4,540 syringes of Clexane from the batch under investigation had been sent to Ireland by the company in November of last year. Clexane has been used to treat more than 118m patients in 96 countries since its launch in 1987.
