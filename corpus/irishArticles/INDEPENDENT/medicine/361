UNAUTHORISED importation of medicinal products, including some obtained by mail order and over the Internet, accounted for nearly a quarter of investigations by the Irish Medicines Board last year. The watchdog body's annual report said mail order-supplied medicines made up half the cases of unauthorised importation. Although mail order breaches increased last year, improved international co-operation meant this trade was constantly being restricted. Last year the organisation seized 44,000 tablets and capsules, 209 liquids and 13kg of creams. Legal proceedings were issued in a number of cases. The report said that "international liaison resulted in one Dutch-based Internet site and one UK-based site ceasing to supply Ireland with medicine products by Internet. "One Irish supplier into the EU for a US-based Internet site ceased to supply following action. We will continue to co-operate with colleagues in other law enforcement and regulatory agencies and abroad in monitoring this area." The report also highlighted how the Irish Medicines Board cracked down on the sale of pharmacy-only products in grocery and retail outlets. It said that public awareness of the organisation's role in safeguarding public health has led to an increase reporting and detection of breaches of legislation. During the year it received 1,161 reports of adverse drug reactions, a fall from 2,282 in 2001. It believes the high level of reports in 2001 was due to the introduction of meningitis C vaccine.
