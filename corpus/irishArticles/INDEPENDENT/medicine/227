IRELAND’S top model Rosanna Davison is set to open her own private clinic in nutritional science. The former Miss World attended the College of Naturopathic Medicine to become a nutritional therapist — and now she is a mission to change the way we eat.  She also intends to write a book on fitness, chanelling her experience of staying in shape for her modelling career. Rosanna, who has specialised in mental health and gut health, said she will work with people on weight loss, fitness and advising on the most appropriate health-supporting diet for their individual make-up.  Speaking to the Sunday Independent before she celebrated her graduation with a family dinner, Rosanna said: “I have been able to help my friends and family with various health problems, and for me, that makes it all worthwhile.”  She says she doesn't own a scales and hasn't weighed herself in years: “I don't really feel guilty about what I eat because I choose foods that nourish my body.” Rosanna criticised Irish people’s eating habits, which she said were heavily focused on processed foods. “Irish diets can be extremely meat-focused, and they often don't contain enough servings of health-protecting fresh fruit and vegetables,” she said.  “Our supermarkets, petrol stations and newsagents are packed with high sugar, high-fat, chemical-laden processed foods at low costs,” she added.
