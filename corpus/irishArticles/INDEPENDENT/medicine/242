A FREE service to dispose of unused or out of date medicines is available from this week to the general public. The 'Dispose of Unused Medicines Properly' (DUMP) campaign, which has been organised by the HSE with the community pharmacists in Cork and Kerry, started this week and will run in participating pharmacies until 8th March 2009. More than 200 pharmacies are participating in the campaign and are actively encouraging people to return unwanted or out of date medicine to them so that it can be disposed of safely and properly. Whatever the reason, the HSE and the pharmacists is urging householders to take this opportunity to dispose of these unwanted medicines (prescription or over the counter) safely. Louise Creed, HSE South Community Care Pharmacist explained why people should take this opportunity to safely dispose of unwanted medicines. "Medication can pose a real hazard in the home, particularly to children or other vulnerable people," she said. "Clearing out your medicine cabinet is something that should be done on a regular basis. Check all the dates and remove anything that is out of date or no longer required."
