The Central Applications Office (CAO) recently issued statistics giving a breakdown of the number of college applications to different course groups throughout the CAO system so  far this year. These always make for interesting reading. The figures are based on a total  of 60,174 applications which were received by February 1, the normal closing date for CAO statistics. Last year, there were 62,802 applicants at this time which was a slight increase on the March 2002 application figures of 62,294. A late closing date applies until May 1 but this facility is usually used by about 2,500 to 3,000 applicants, so it should only marginally alter the trends. The statistics show both the total number of first preferences stated for any course grouping and the total mentions of a course. Applicants may apply for up to 10 courses in order of preference, on two lists: a degree list and a diploma/certificate list. A total of 54,263 applicants used the degree list while 43,305 of them used the diploma/certificate list. Of the 54,263 applicants to degree courses, exactly 25pc of them, or 13,565 individuals, listed a course in the arts/social science group as their first preference. This is slightly lower than last year's total when 25.38pc of all first preferences for degree courses were for the arts/social science grouping. But it is still, by far, the largest percentage applying to any one course category. This figure may surprise many but it is a tribute to the good sense of applicants to pick a first-degree course that is interesting, flexible and that can be used in so many different career settings. CAO lists 15 different degree course groupings, including arts/social science. The others are: science/applied science, agriculture/horticulture, education, administration/business, engineering/technology, architecture, art and design, law, human medicine, veterinary medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, physiotherapy and, finally, other health care courses. The biggest single category of first preferences after arts is to courses under the heading 'administration/business' with 9,302 first preferences. This represents just over 17pc of all degree first preferences, just slightly less than the 18pc of first preferences in that category last year. The numbers applying to degree courses in engineering/technology have slightly decreased with a total of 7,428 first preferences, or nearly 13.7pc of all degree applicants, as compared to 7,736 at this time last year (14pc). But it is still the third highest category. Applications to human medicine have gone up again with more people listing medicine as their first choice this year than last year or 2002. Figures for this year show that 2,098 applicants listed human medicine as their first preference as compared with 1,834 first preferences by March 2003. This represents an increase of over 14pc which certainly seems huge but the actual percentage of degree applicants applying to human medicine is only 3.86pc. Last year, first preference applicants to human medicine represented about 3.32pc of all degree first preferences. Undoubtedly, the rise in this year's human medicine applicant numbers means that it is likely to be even harder to get into medical schools but that will not be of concern to over 96pc of CAO applicants. The actual numbers and percentages of first preferences to veterinary medicine (528 or 0.97pc) and dentistry (218 or 0.4pc) are low. Physiotherapy has attracted more first preferences in recent years, from 876 in 2002 and 1,033 in 2003 to 1,103 (or a little over 2pc of all degree applicants) this year. There are now four degree programmes. These are available at UCD, Trinity, the Royal College of Surgeons and the University of Limerick. The category 'other health care degree courses' includes radiography, occupational therapy, speech therapy and, of course, nursing. This was included on CAO's degree course lists for the first time last year, resulting in an increase from 729 first preferences for other health care courses in 2002 to 5,464 in 2003. This number has risen to 5,829 in 2004 and so represents the fourth largest course applicant category with 10.74pc of all degree applicants listing it as their first preference. All CAO applicants have a change of mind facility, subject to a few restrictions, up to July 1. Open evening: tonight at 7pm in Sallynoggin College of Further Education, Pearse Street, Sallynoggin, Dun Laoghaire, Co Dublin.
