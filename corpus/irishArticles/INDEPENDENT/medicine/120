Herbal medicines have a lot of devoted followers in Ireland, however, being 'natural' doesn't necessarily mean they're safe for you to take.  Herbal medicines, just like conventional medicines, will have an effect on the body and can be potentially harmful if not used correctly. They should therefore be used with the same care and respect as conventional medicines. If you're taking or plan to take any herbal medicines, be aware of the following: • They may cause problems if you're taking other medicines. They could result in reduced or enhanced effects of the medicines, including potential side effects. • You may experience a bad reaction or side effects after taking a herbal medicine. • Always mention the herbal medicine you intend to take to your doctors. • The risks of obtaining fake, substandard, unlicensed or contaminated medicines are increased by buying medicines online or by mail order.
