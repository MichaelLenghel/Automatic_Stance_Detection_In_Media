WOMEN who use complementary therapies while trying to conceive by IVF are less likely to get pregnant than those who use conventional medicine alone, research indicates. A study of 818 Danish fertility patients revealed that pregnancy rates were about 20pc lower among users of alternative medicine, such as reflexology and acupuncture, than among those who did not use such treatments. The findings could mean that complementary medicines that have a biological effect, such as herbal remedies or nutritional supplements, interfere with fertility drugs or other aspects of IVF treatment. Women who turn to alternative medicine, however, tend to be more stressed by their infertility, and may have been trying for longer to get pregnant. The lower success rate could reflect that these patients are willing to try anything. "It may be that complementary therapies diminish the effectiveness of medical interventions," said Jacky Boivin, of Cardiff University, who led the research. "Or it may simply be that persistent treatment failure encourages women to seek out complementary and alternative therapies." Edzard Ernst, Professor of Complementary Medicine at Exeter University, said: "Similar associations have been made in cancer patients; those who use complementary or alternative medicine [CAM] are on average more distressed and more depressed. The important question is whether the chicken or the egg came first. The most likely explanation is that those women who are prone to stress and have more health problems are more likely to try CAM." The study, which was conducted with the University of Copenhagen, suggested that 31pc of fertility patients had used an alternative treatment, with reflexology and nutritional supplements the most popular.
