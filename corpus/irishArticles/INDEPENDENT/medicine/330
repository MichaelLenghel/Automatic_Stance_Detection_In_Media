THE reduction in the price of branded medicines should also be extended to animal veterinary products, according to ICSA president Gabriel Gilmartin. "If the price of medicines for patients can be reduced by 40% the same reduction should also apply to animal health products. Each of the major pharmaceutical companies has an animal health division and a very lucrative market in Ireland. If this reduction can apply to medicines for people, there is no reason why it can't be the same for veterinary medicines," he said. Mr Gilmartin said Agriculture Minister Brendan Smith should raise the issue with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA), the representative body for the major pharmaceutical companies in Ireland. "The Minister needs to follow in the footsteps of his colleague the Minister for Health and negotiate a reduction for farmers in the cost of animal medicines," the ICSA leader said.
