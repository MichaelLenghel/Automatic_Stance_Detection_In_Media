PARENTS are to be given better guidelines on how much Calpol or liquid paracetamol to give their children because many of them may have been giving too little. The easier 'dose per age' instructions are aimed at ensuring children receive the most effective dosage of the popular medicines, including Calpol, Panadol Baby and Paralink. "The updated information will include more precise age and dosage bands to ensure that children get the most effective amount of medicine for their needs whilst making it easier for parents and carers to know how much paracetamol they should give their children," the Irish Medicines Board said. Up to now, liquid paracetamol-containing medicines had two single age bands -- from three months to one year and from one year to six years. The revised guidelines cover four separate age bands of three to six months, six to 24 months, two to four years and four to six years. Babies can be given paracetamol to treat fever or pain if they are over two months old. While paracetamol dosing in hospitals and healthcare settings is based on the child's weight, the new advice for parents at home is based on the child's age. The new guidelines will encourage parents or carers to use the dosing spoon provided with the medicine to ensure that the correct amount of medicine is given to children. It is also advised to thoroughly shake the bottle before giving your child the dose to ensure that the paracetamol was evenly distributed within the liquid. Irish Independent
