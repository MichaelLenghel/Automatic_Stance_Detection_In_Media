One-quarter of all adults in Ireland are taking medicine prescribed by their doctors, according to a survey commissioned by the Women's Health Council. The council says the research has found that financially disadvantaged women are the most likely people to be taking prescription medicine. Women are also twice as likely as men to take medicine to treat a mental health condition. The survey has found that 40% of men and 25% of women are taking some form of medicine to treat a chronic physical condition.
