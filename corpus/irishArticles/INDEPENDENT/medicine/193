The NPIC is a 24-hour advice service offered to professionals in the medical industry. They help identify symptoms and give advice on treatment. The Centre received 451 calls from the Louth area in 2001, compared to 231 in Meath, 121 in Cavan and just 59 in Monaghan. The difference in quantity may be explained by regional population differences. Although the NEHB are promoting the safe disposal of unwanted household medicines, the NPIC offer advice on a number of potential poisons including not just medical products but household items, industrial chemicals and even plants. In 2001, the group received 2,375 calls nationally concerning children under the age of five who had taken medicines in error. The Disposal of Unwanted Medicines Campaign, which was launched last week, urges that any medicines not required be given over to local pharmacists. The move encourages regular check-ups around the house for any medicines that may be out of date, including both prescription and over the counter brands. They also recommend that all medical products, including seemingly harmless ones like cough bottles and vitamin tonics, be locked safely away from children.
