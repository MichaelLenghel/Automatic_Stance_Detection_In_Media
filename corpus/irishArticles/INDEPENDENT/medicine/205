A PARENT whose child is discharged from hospital on a Friday or Saturday may not be able to get vital medication until the following week because of licensing red tape, pharmacists warn. They blame excessive bureaucracy and difficulties in the licensing process for putting patients at unnecessary discomfort or risk. The Irish Pharmaceutical Union (IPU) has called on Health Minister Micheal Martin to ease restrictions to ensure the availability of drugs which have previously been licensed in Ireland or have got the green light in other EU countries. Darragh O' Loughlin, chairman of the IPU's community pharmacy committee said these unlicensed medicines do not have a current product authorisation from the Irish Medicines Board. They also include medicines which do not have a European marketing authorisation and typically are older drugs whose use has reduced. The manufacturer may no longer see it as viable to incur the expense of renewing the licence in a small market like Ireland, he said. "Even medicines with well established safety and efficacy profiles can be affected by this kind of commercial decision". European studies show they can account for 80pc of medicines used in neo-natal intensive care units or 40pc of medicines used in paediatric intensive care. He said: "A patient who is prescribed an unlicensed medicine often has to wait several days before a pharmacist can source the drug from another country where it is still available". It is even more difficult for people with medical cards as the GMS scheme does not cover these medications. They either have to pay for expensive medication or apply under the 'hardship scheme' a complicated process taking several days.
