The Education Minister's plans for a  shake-up in health care courses has been given a major boost by the Royal College of  Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI). The Minister for Education, Noel Dempsey, has told the universities he wants students intending to study medicine, veterinary or related courses to sign up initially for a common science degree. The intention is that when they get their science degree they would then enrol in medicine, veterinary or another course, if they wished. The proposal was welcomed yesterday by the RCSI which disclosed that it had already done considerable planning on a four-year graduate entry programme for the study of medicine. At present, students take five or six years to qualify in medicine after which they must do an internship lasting one year. Deputy Chief Executive Michael Horgan said the College had engaged consultants and had examined how graduate entry to medicine worked in countries such as Australia and the United States. The RCSI plans would fit in well with what the minister was proposing and it would be happy to discuss the proposals, Mr Horgan added. The minister's proposals could mean a lengthening of the time it takes to qualify as a doctor if the universities follow the RCSI model of a four-year graduate entry programme. Sources pointed out that delayed entry would mean applicants were more mature when they entered medicine. This might cut down on the numbers who qualify in medicine but do not practise it.
