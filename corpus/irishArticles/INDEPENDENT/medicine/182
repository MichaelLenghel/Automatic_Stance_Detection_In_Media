Anti-impotence drugs, skin-lightening products, steroids, antidepressants and weight-loss drugs were among the products seized by officers of the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) last year. In total, the IMB seized 96,487 tablets, 41,361 capsules, 52,873 liquids and 5,652 creams. It had 797 enforcement cases during the year -- a big jump on the 430 orders in 2005. It received 1,900 reports of adverse reactions to medicines over the course of the year. IMB chief executive Pat O'Mahoney said this represented an increase in adverse reaction reports and he asked healthcare professionals to be vigilant. Licensed The report said the number of applications processed for human medicines was 17,725 in 2006 and 848 new products were licensed, comprising both "over-the-counter" and prescription-only medicines. A total of 58 recalls of medicinal products were ordered by the IMB during the year -- 56 related to human medicines and two related to veterinary. "The focus on the threat posed by counterfeit medicines was maintained during 2006 and the IMB contributed to the efforts of the Council of Europe and the World Health Organisation towards the development of anti-counterfeiting strategies," said Mr O'Mahoney.
