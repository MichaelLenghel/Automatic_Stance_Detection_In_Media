COUGH and cold medicines should not be given to children under two years of age without first getting the advice of a pharmacist or doctor. Dr Joan Gilvarry, director of Human Medicines, at the Irish Medicines Board, advises parents with children who have symptoms of a cough or cold and a temperature, to treat the child with the appropriate amount of paracetamol or ibuprofen. These products can improve the child's symptoms and can be used in conjunction with cough syrups such as glycerol, honey or lemon as opposed to syrups containing active ingredients. "Our advice for parents or child minders is to seek the advice of a pharmacist or doctor before giving any medication to a child under two years of age. "Before any medicine is administered to a child, parents should read the patient information leaflet carefully and strictly administer the correct dosage as dictated." Dr Gilvarry said the use of cough and cold medicines in older children is currently under review at a European level.
