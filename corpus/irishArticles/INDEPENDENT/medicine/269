A CAMPAIGN encouraging people in Kerry to safely dispose of unused or out of date medicines has seen almost a tonne of unused medicines collected in participating pharmacies around the county Over 100 bins of medicines were safely disposed of as part of the free 'Dispose of Unused Medicines Properly (DUMP)' campaign which was organised by the HSE South and the community pharmacists in Kerry and supported by Kerry County Council and the Regional Waste Management Office. In Kerry the 2009 campaign saw more than 914kgs of unwanted medicines deposited in special collection bins placed in participating pharmacies. This compared to 395.6kgs collected during the last similar campaign in 2007. "As well as the hazards posed by overdose, accidental poisoning and damage to the environment, medicines can change when out of date and may end up being harmful to those who take them," an HSE spokesperson warned.
