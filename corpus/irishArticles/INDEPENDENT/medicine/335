TRADITIONAL CHINESE Medicine is a comprehensive system that has been proven effective in the treatment of a wide range of illnesses for over 3,000 years making it one of the world's oldest bodies of organised medicine. Due to the success of its unique holistic approach, TCM has spread from its Chinese origins to other parts of the world and has evolved to keep in step with contemporary health issues. The World Health Organisation is involved in ongoing clinical trials concerning the treatment of diseases for which Acupuncture has shown therapeutic results. TCM THERAPIES The most familiar TCM therapy is Acupuncture. Extremely fine, single-use pre-sterilised stainless steel needles are inserted at specific points on the body to achieve a therapeutic effect. Besides Acupuncture, a wide variety of therapies are available to the qualified practitioner which includes Chinese Herbal Medicine, Moxibustion, Cupping, Dietary Therapy, Therapeutic Massage, Therapeutic Exercises and Lifestyle Advice. The various treatments may be used singly, or in combination depending on the nature of the illness. TCM PRACTITIONER Christopher M. Davala (Lic. TCM) has been practicing TCM since 1988 and is a member of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Council of Ireland and the Irish Register of Chinese Herbal Medicine. He has conducted a regular clinic in Sligo for 23 years. For queries and appointments phone 01-2801740 (Dublin) or 071-9161796 (Sligo).
