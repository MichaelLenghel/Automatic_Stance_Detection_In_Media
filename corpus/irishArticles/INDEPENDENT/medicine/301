ANABOLIC steroids, human growth hormones, weight loss products and skin lightening creams were among the illegally imported items seized by the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) last year. The annual report of the drugs' policing body showed other products seized including botox, the substance which can be injected to remove wrinkles, anti-impotence drugs, prescription only herbs and high dose vitamins. It also made a significant seizure of more than 700,000 counterfeit condoms during the year, according to the report. They were part of 65,044 tablets, 17,456 capsules, 2,971 liquids and 6,525g of creams seized during the year. Four people were arrested in Dublin for the internet supply of anabolic steroids, following a joint operation by the IMB and the gardai. Overall, its enforcement section noted a marked increase in the number of cases brought for breaches of medicinal product law - up 78pc to 561. "We received 1,861 suspected adverse drug reactions (ADR) reports in 2005. All cases were followed up individually. It is crucial for the IMB to receive these valuable reports as they assist in monitoring the safety of medicines on the market," IMB chiefexecutive Pat O'Mahony said. "We would urge all healthcare professionals to be vigilant and to report ADRs to the IMB through the various mechanisms we have made available." In relation to product recalls in 2005, 68 related to human medicines, six referred to veterinary medicines and 89 were about medical devices. It said the The Human Medicines Department recorded its most successful year to date with an increase in the number of licence applications processed. "The number of applications processed for human medicines including new product authorisations, renewals and variations to product authorisations, rose by 8pc from 16,669 in 2004."
