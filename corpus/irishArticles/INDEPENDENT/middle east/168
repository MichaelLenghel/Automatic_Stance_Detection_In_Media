IN the Freeman column of September 13 under the headline CRH is jeopardising its Middle East opportunity, it was suggested that CRH is losing out in the Middle East because of its decision to invest in an Israeli building  materials group. CRH has indicated to us that it takes serious issue with the material and the views expressed in the article, especially when it appeared in such a sensitive week for both the US and the entire Middle East. The article suggested that the company's failure to buy state Egyptian cement maker Helwan was an example of how its Israeli investment is hampering its progress in the region. CRH has pointed out to us that while it was invited to make an offer for Helwan and did express an initial interest, it did not make a bid for it; nor did it bid for Suez Cement as the article suggested and therefore it did not fail to buy either company. It has also been pointed out that the recent bond offer was not related in any way to possible Middle Eastern expansion and was never positioned with institutions as such. CRH has informed us that while the region is of interest, it is not viewed as an immediate priority growth area. CRH has said that it fundamentally disagrees with conclusions drawn in the article, and rejects any suggestions that it has been naive in its strategy in the region or impoverished shareholders in any way, as Freeman suggested. The company has in fact achieved compound annual growth in shareholders' returns of 22pc over the last 30 years. We acknowledge that given the attacks on America last week, there was extreme sensitivity around these issues and we certainly did not intend to cause any offence at such a traumatic time for so many people.
