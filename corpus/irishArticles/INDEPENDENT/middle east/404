Engineering consultancy Byrne Looby is creating 50 new jobs as it expands in Ireland and the Middle East. The company, which has its headquarters in Dublin, is looking for engineers, project managers and business support staff. It provides specialist advisory services on civil engineering and wind, water and marine projects. Recent projects include a 40km tunnel in Abu Dhabi and a port in Jordan. It was also involved in the construction of Heathrow Terminal 2 and the Shard in London, the UK's tallest building. Recruitment begins today. The company is looking both for entry-level staff and senior employees. It was ranked in the top 20 recruiters last year by 'New Civil Engineer' magazine. Half of the new recruits will be based in Ireland – the company has offices in Cork, Galway and Belfast as well as Dublin – and half will be based overseas. About 70pc of its revenues now come from foreign activities, particularly the Middle East, including operations in Libya, Qatar and Dubai. The company was founded in 1997 by business partners Michael Looby and John Byrne, and expanded overseas in 2006. Irish Independent
