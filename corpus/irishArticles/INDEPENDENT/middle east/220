THE FIRST-EVER international hurling tournament was held in Galway recently. Sixteen teams from around the world took part in the event which was sponsored by Aer Lingus and Etihad Airways as part of the Gathering 2013. Teams from America, Canada, Argentina, Asia and Australia took part in the event, including four Wexford players who were privileged to be flown home from the Middle East. All four have been living in the Middle East for a while now and are keen hurlers, so it was an honour to be selected to represent them. The men in question Terry Kehoe of Bahrain (Cloughbawn), Michael Redmond of Dubai (Rathnure), Shane Rackard of Dubai (Duffry Rovers) and Caymon Flynn of Al Ain (St. Patrick's). The Middle East team took part in the Division 2 competition with Milwaukee, a selection of players from across Europe called Europe (Irish) and Canada. The Middle East team were victorious against Canada in the final held in Pearse Stadium in front of a large crowd including the G.A.A. President, Liam O'Neill. Gorey Guardian
