Tony Blair is urging both sides in the Middle East conflict to take advantage of a new "sense of possibility" in the region. Mr Blair was making his first public comments since being appointed as a peace envoy for the so-called Quartet of mediators overseeing the peace process. He is currently in the Middle East for two days of meetings with Israeli and Palestinian leaders and says he can already sense a willingness by both sides to make progress. Speaking in Jerusalem, he said: "I think there is a sense of possibility, but whether that can be translated into something, that is something that needs to be worked at and thought about over time."
