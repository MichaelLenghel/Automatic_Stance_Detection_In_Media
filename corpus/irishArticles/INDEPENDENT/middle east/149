Seniors Our Seniors sponsored by Maurice Foley of MF Decorating began their 2015 campaign well on Sunday when they hosted an understrength Laune Rangers team in Beaufort. Laune Rangers settled better and were ahead in the first quarter but Beaufort had points from Niall O'Connor, Liam Caey (2) , Fergal Hallissey and a free from Kevin O'Brien and once Padraig O'Sullivan scored their first of 3 goals in the first half the game was over on the scoreboard. Their 2nd goal came from Fergal Hallissey after his mid-field partner Francis Courtney put him through while the 3rd came from full-forward Kevin O'Brien after an accurate corss-field pass from Danny Healy. The half ended in drama when Beaufort's goalkeeper Mike Moriarty hauled down Kerry player and mid-fielder Peter Crowley for a penalty. Peter took the penalty himself but Mike redeemed himself and brought off a fine save. Half-time score Beaufort 3-5 Laune Rangers 0-7 . Laune Rangers had a lot of missed chances and also came up against a hard-working defence while Beaufort picked away with scores - 2 points from Francis Courtney (1free), 2 fine points from wing-back Sean Fogarty and full-back Gerard Hartnett. Fergal Hallissey had a 45 and one from play while Jason Foley had Beaufort's 4th goal.  Fixtures Beaufort Minors away to John Mitchels on Sat, 21st February at 4pm in Co Minor Lge, Round 1.

This game was due to be played in Currow at 12 noon, but when the Listry team and manager arrived in Currow and found another game in progress at 11-45 the decided they were not waiting. They decided to move the game to Listry and the game did not start there until 1-15 approx. This was done without the knowledge of the referee or the East Kerry Board. When the game did get going the pace was quiet slow, it being the first game of the new season and underfoot conditions were heavy. Currow got off to the better start and were four points to two up by the quarter hour mark. By half hour the score was seven points to three in favour of Currow. Scorers for Currow in the first half were Dan O' Shea (2p) Pa Mc Carthy (1p, 1-45) Seamus Brosnan, Padraig O' Shea, Paudie Collins 1p each and for Listry Ronan Buckley (2p) Joseph Clifford (1p).  By the end of the third quarter Listry had closed the gap to two points with points from their mid fielder and Buckley again. Currow again took hold of the game and with points from Padraig O'Shea, Dan O' Shea and John Mc Mahon lead by ten points to five going into the last five minutes. Listry added two further points one more from their midfielder and one from their sub Kevin Courtney leaving the full time score Currow 0-10 Listry 0-07  The February lotto draw will be held in Cunniffes Bar Currow on next Sunday night February 22nd for a jackpot of EUR2,700-00.

The club would like to congratulate Brosna and Ardfert on being crowned Junior and Intermediate Champions in Croke Park on Saturday last.

DR CROKES  The Senior Football squad started their competitive season with two East Kerry Senior League fixtures in 48 hours, both under lights at Lewis Rd.  On Wednesday 11 Feb 2015, Listry were the visitors and a strong Crokes selection recorded a 2-13 to 0-05 victory to open their 2015 campaign, the goals coming courtesy of Brian Looney and Andrew Kenneally.  Then on Friday 13th, Cordal were defeated 4-19 to 0-05.  This time the goals were supplied by Jamie Doolan, Chris Brady(2) and Mike Milner. Chris set up Jamie to raise the first green flag of the evening, then added a brace himself, the first after good approach work by Brian Looney, the second from the spot after Cian O'Neill was fouled. Mike Milner finished to the roof of the net in adding a fourth Crokes goal.  Chris Brady finished the game with a superb 2-10 and it was good to see Alan Kelly back between the sticks, adding further competition for the Crokes number one jersey.    The U21s played their previously postponed East Kerry Div 1 Championship game away to Rathmore on Sunday 15 March at midday but will have to do it all again as the game finished Rathmore 4-09, Dr Crokes 1-18, after extra time.    The Minors start their County League fixtures with a game away to Kerins O'Rahillys at 4pm on Saturday 21 February.

Down 15 points at halftime having played into a strong wind, they outscored their opponents by 7 points with the elements but still came up short on account of not taking a number of chances created.

Minors - Our minor team begin their County League campaign this Saturday 21st February when they play Brosna/Knocknagoshel in Brosna at 4pm, all support welcome.  Seniors - Our senior team travelled to Scartaglin on Sunday morning to play their opening East Kerry league game, Fossa lined out with a vastly depleted team with up to 16 players missing but however they fielded a team of mostly minor and U-21 players. Scartaglin proved much too strong on this occasion and ran out easy winners in the end on a scoreline of 2-13 to 0-3. Great credit to the Fossa players who played their heart out and gave it their all in heavy underfoot conditions, the one positive that came out of this match is that the club has to field a Junior team this year in order to give all these young players football over the summer, we obviously have the numbers and we cannot afford to leave these young players slip away due to a lack of game time and competition. We will now play Kenmare in Fossa on Sunday next 22nd February at 12 noon.  Rhyno Quality Feeds Senior County League Div 4: Fossa played hosts to Glenflesk last Sunday morning in the Div 4, Rhyno Quality Feeds Senior County League.  Fossa started well and we had three points by Julie Cronin, Erica McGlynn and Clodagh Fitzgerald notched up within the first 10 minutes. Glenflesk did not give up and our three backs of Niamh O Sullivan, Fay O Donoghue and Katie Talbot had to defend well to keep our opponents at bay. Corah McGlynn was on hand to make numerous saves and kept the rivals score down. Fossa passed the ball well and we gained 3 goals in quick sucession, two from Julie Cronin and one from Marie Foran, this had the Fossa girls firmly in control. Amy Moriarty, wing back, who had a tremendous game along with Anna O Reilly. Fossa led at half time 3-5 to 0-2. Glenflesk started well in the second half, but Fossa had more strength in their forwards. Lauren Rintoul as always caught every ball that came to her and with Breeda Kelleher and Sarah Doody playing incredible football we soon closed out the game on a score line of 4 -14 to 1 -3.  GLENBEIGH               GLENCAR Mid-Kerry League 2015: Cromane 0-9 Glenbeigh/Glencar 3-17  Glenbeigh/Glencar opened their 2015 account with an impressive victory against a weak Cromane team, both teams were missing a number of players but it was the div 4 team that struggled the most. This was a big day for three of the Glenbeigh/Glencar players Caolim Teahan, Donal O=92Neill & Joseph Murphy who all made their senor debuts.   Cromane were first on the score board with a point by full forward Emmet Casey who took advantage of a rare mistake by Fergal Griffin, Glenbeigh/Glencar quickly levelled things up with a fine score from Podge Griffin. Cromane went ahead with points from Darren Houlihan & a free from Micheal Shaughnessy, this was to be Cromanes last score of the half as Glenbeigh/Glencar upped their game considerably 2 pts from corner forward Daniel Griffin, three points from centre forward Caolim Teahan, a fisted point from midfielder Colin McGillicuddy and a very fortunate goal by full forward John Joe Quirke leaving the half time score Cromane 0-9 Glenbeigh/Glencar 1-7. It must be said that a poor decision by the referee to black card one of the Cromane players after 15 min did little to help Cromanes cause.   Glenbeigh/Glencar brought in Jason McKenna & Kieran Cahillane for the impressive duo Daniel Griffin & Coalim Teahan. Cromane started the second half much the same as the first with two unanswered frees from corner forward Micheal Shaughnessy, Glenbeigh/Glencar again responded well no more so than second half substitute Jason Mckenna who kicked a fantastic score to steady the ship once more. Cromane battled hard but were restricted to just one score from play from centre back Mikey Houlihan, Glenbeigh/Glencar however moved up a gear and scored another two goals and 9 points to run out easy winners.  Team & scorers: D.O'Neill, K.Doyle, F.Griffin (0-1), D.Murphy, V.Hoare, D.McGilliycuddy, J.Hoare, J.Brosnan, D.O'Sullivan (0-1), C.Teahan (0-3), P.Griffin (0-4), K.Courtney (0-1), JJ.Quirke (1-0), D.Griffin (0-2). Subs: J.McKenna (1-3) for C.Teahan, K.Cahillane (0-2) for D.Griffin, S.Roche for JJ. Quirke, M.O'Sullivan for V.Hoare, J.Murphy for D.Murphy.

GLENFLESK EAST KERRY SENIOR LEAGUE: The Glenflesk senior team, sponsored by the Jarvey's Rest, drew with Spa in an EK Senior League game played in blustery conditions in Glenflesk on Sunday February 15th. Playing with the benefit of a strong breeze Glenflesk led by 1-9 to 1-4 at half-time, but a couple of second-half Spa goals gave them a slight advantage at the mid-point of the half. Jeff O'Donoghue kicked a last minute free to leave the final score Glenflesk 1-11 Spa 3-5, and bring his personal tally for the day to 10 points (0-4f) which included some brilliant long range scores.

Like last week a good team performance, with Colm Dan in midfield very consistent over the hour and with the management trying out players it is good to see a big score on the board again. The first half was tight, 1-5 to 0-2 at the break in our favour. Colm Dan caught some great ball and took a point on 17 minutes and it was his catch and pass that set up Mark Crowley for a point on 25 minutes. Between those two scores Sean O'Leary nabbed a green flag (a goal last week also) and Rory O'Sullivan was getting an awful lot of work done to keep us on the front foot.  With ten minutes gone in the second half this game looked like being a rout. Paul O'Connor had two early points before Dean Cassidy spun in on goal and jit the net. On 38 minutes a quick O'Connor pass put Tarmac in and he also made no mistake and when Mark Crowley added a point we were seemingly coastingÖ  Back came Firies with their centre-forward in particular making wreck, with ten minutes left there were only four points between the sides but points from Dean Cassidy, a brace from Paul O'Connor and fittingly, a Colm Dan effort, we ran out eight point winners.  Kenmare: Ciaran Fitzgibbon; Brian Clifford, Ritchie O'Sullivan, Aidan Quinlan; David Crowley, Sean O'Leary (1-1), Rob Hodnett; Colm Dan O'Sullivan (0-2), Shane Dalton; Rory O'Sullivan, Mark Crowley (0-4, 1fr), Shane O'Sullivan (1-0); Dean Cassidy (1-1), Paul O'Connor (0-4, 0-2fs), Eoin Finnegan.

SENIOR SEASON: Our Senior Men began their 2015 season on Sunday with a visit to Beaufort in the Mid Kerry League. Rangers started brightly, and found themselves ahead by 0-4 to 0-2 on the quarter mark - Com O'Shea (2 frees), Kevin Flynn & Aidan Cox for Rangers with Beaufort's scores from Niall O'Connor & Liam Carey. Colm O'Shea added another free for Rangers but Beaufort then took full control in the second quarter. Goals from Padraig O'Sullivan, Fergal Hallissey & Kevin O'Brien along with points from Hallissey, O'Brien (free) and Liam Carey gave the home side a commanding lead (3-5 to 0-7) approaching Half Time.  Beaufort continued their fine start to the season in the 2nd half. Points from Francis Courtney (2, 1f), Kevin O'Brien & Sean Courtney put the home side 3-9 to 0-7 ahead with a quarter remaining. It didn't improve for Rangers in the closing stages. Jason Foley found the net again for the home side and points from Ger Hartnett & Fergal Hallissey (2) completed the rout. Rangers' only scores in the second half came from points by John O'Shea (free) and Shane O'Connor to put the final score at; Beaufort 4-12, Laune Rangers 0-9.  Our Senior Ladies travelled to Rathmore in the Round 1 of the County League and came out on top 5-11 to 1-04 in Laune Rangers' favour. Meadhbh Johnston and Amy Foley stood out for Laune Rangers in a game where all Kerry players played well for the visitors - a good all round team performance for the opening round of the league  UNDER 14: Laune Rangers under 14's played their first match of the season on Sunday last, when they faced Na Gaeil in Cloon. While they started slowly and went behind by 3-6 to 0-2 in the  first quarter, they responded like true warriors and won the contest in all corners of the field.

SENIOR EAST KERRY LEAGUE - Seniors opened their Superleague campaign with a win over Gneeveguilla in Direen.A game worthwhile for the Senior debuts of Rob Leen,Darragh Doherty, Alan Moriarty,Kyle and Bryan Griffin.David Mc Carthy figured well while Ciaran O Grady and Sgt Denis Sheahan  If Legion started the opening half in whirlwind fashion, it was Gneeveguilla who did the same in the second period as they rattled off four unanswered points, two from frees and two from play before Alan Moriarty found the net for Legion to restore their lead, a lead that they held onto until the final whistle but only just, as eventhough Sean Mc Carthy and Twomey raised more white flags to give the homeside a four point cushion entering the final few minutes, some great determination by Gneeveguilla saw them apply fierce pressure and this pressure was rewarded with a late goal to set up an exciting fianle but Legion held on to win by the bare minimum . Final score Legion 1-13 Gneeveguilla 2-09   U21 EAST KERRY - Same two teams, same pitch,quite a few same players, different result. Gneeveguilla exacted some revenge on the Legion in this u21 East Kerry Div 2 semi final as they reversed the scoreline of the previous evenings encounter between the same two clubs at senior level . Throughout the entire match, there was very little between theses sides as at any stage in this fixture was there ever more than a couple of points separating the teams . At the short whistle Gneeveguilla led by two points 0-07 v 0-05 Eamon Herlihy and Cornelius Buckley to the fore for Gneeveguilla while Rob Leen,Cathal Sheahan and Jack o Neill were prominent for Legion along with some fine long distance free taking by midfielder Donal Lyne . The second half was where most of the action came from and when Conor Culloty goalled for Legion, it looked like the town side might jut shade it but Gneeveguilla had other ideas and when Herlihy scored a long range point it seemed to lift the Gneeveguilla team and this was quickly followed by a Cornelius Buckley goal with the visitors holding on for a single point victory .

Megan O Connell and Bernie Cronin were winning alot of ball around the middle and with Anna Galvin providing the link to the forwards it helped to send the girls in at half time on a scoreline of 0.09 to 0.01. Inbhear Sceine started to pick up some good scores and were putting some pressure on the girls until Megan O Connell got a well worked goal ending the game on a score of 1.14 to 0.08.

Senior East Kerry Super League Round 2: Glenflesk 1-11, Spa 3-5.  Spa had their 2nd outing of the year against Glenflesk on Sunday morning. This game was played in very windy conditions in Glenflesk and turned out to be a "game of two halves". Glenflesk played with the wind the first half and used the wind very well with some outstanding long range points from Jeff O Donoghue. Spa had to work really hard to get the ball up the field against this strong wind and many of our attacks broke down. Craig Hickey managed to kick 3 points from frees to keep us in touch for the first 20 minutes. Ryan Carroll scored a fine point in the 25th minute to bring Spa within 5 points. In the 27th minute Lee O Donoghue struck for a super goal for Glenflesk and it looked like Spa were in big trouble. However the heads didn't drop and in the 29th minute John Falvey fisted the ball into the net after a great cross from Ryan O Carroll. This left the score at half time at 1-4 for Spa, 1 -9 for Glenflesk.  With the strong wind at our back Spa started the second half very well and in the 3rd minute Craig Hickey landed a long ball into the goalmouth and Rory O Riordan finished the breaking ball to the net. Scores were scarce from here on with nothing being scored by either side until the 15th minute when Spa struck for another goal, Ryan O Carroll providing the finish on this occasion. Glenflesk scored their first point of the second half when Jeff O Donoghue finished off a fine passing move. Spa scored again in the 23rd minute with a lovely point from the boot of Rory O Riordan. Spa were now up by 1 point but failed to add to this lead over the last 7 minutes. On the stroke of full time Glenflesk got a free on the 20 meter line and Jeff O Donoghue made no mistake .   The game finished Spa 3-5, Glenflesk 1-11.  Minor Co.

What a weekend for the club and Kerry with all 4 teams that represented Munster came away from City West Hotel with All Ireland glory. History was made once again in the Club as these are the first teams to win in these both Quiz and Figure Dancing. Last year was the first with Recitation and Set Dancing. What a huge accomplishment for our Club with 4 All Ireland titles in two years.   The quiz team started the winning streak in the morning in a closely contested battle winning by 2 points with a great result 68. The winning team Thomas Fleming, James Lynch, Michael Aherne and Niamh Clifford put in long hours along with excellent coaches Seamus Clifford and Eileen Aherne. Our Figure dancers were up first in the afternoon, danced brilliantly and were clear winners in this competition. When the results were announced the crowd erupted with huge applause and the excitement was electrifying. The team consisted of Aine Brosnan, Katie Cronin, Megann Cronin, Ava O Sullivan, Leah Moynihan, Rachel Moynihan, Sarah Randles and Lamia Switzer. Coaches Mairead Mangan and Maureen Hegarty Vogels who are no strangers to All Ireland Glory as they hold in combination 17 All Scor Sinear medals in both set and figure. So its no surprise, success breathes success and have passed on their expertise to the next generation of our young dancers. All this success in Scor is the driving force in the form of Sheila McCarthy who's our Scor Officer in her 12th year in this position. She organises all groups Paisti, Og and Sinsear with precision and untold experience with every level. Sheila along with her committee are owed a huge Bula Bos and we hope that they continue for many more years in this capacity. A homecoming was awaiting the winning teams in Spa with a Bonfire and were welcomed by our own member Mayor of Killarney, John Joe Culloty and his wife Mary. Ger Mangan, Chairman and John O Donoghue Chairman, Coiste na nOg congratulated all involved and thanked the huge crowd that turned up in the Clubhouse. Sheila also congratulated the other Kerry Champions from Lisople (solo singing) and Ardfert (music).

WATERVILLE  This game was your typical first game of the year with some lovely moves and some questionable defending by both teams.To be fair Waterville were by far the better team and were cruising to a win in the second half but for Renard's spirited fightback twice through goals the third to bring it within 2 points with a few minutes left.  My man of the match Steven Dwyer ended the day with a personal tally of 1-6 from the 2-10 and was unmarkable for large amounts of time in the second half especially,his foot passing and scoring was a joy to watch in this first match of the year. Waterville's remaining scores came from 2 lovely points from Eoin Sullivan (one placed ball from around the 40) who did well for his first game in a senior jersey in a while,1 raiding point from the centre back Odhran o Mahony who also was a returnee to the first team and and the remaining 1-1 was for our first scorer of the new year in the mighty Sam Dwyer, tho small in height we expect a big year from this man as his goal showed he really has his father's Mike eye for goal when bursting through and riffling the roof of the net early in the game.  Waterville will be happy to get off to a win and had a lot of positives from the game, but also have a lot of work to get to where there expectation levels are for the year ahead.  Our next assignment is next weekend against the South Kerry holder St Marys in Cahirciveen.  The Waterville club and its members along with the community would like to congratulate Brosna and Ardfert on there All Ireland victories. Kerryman
