Britain is just days away from another petrol price rise if the Middle East crisis continues, the industry warned today. News Update, 13/10/00, 16:03 Britain is just days away from another petrol price rise if the Middle East crisis continues, the industry warned today. Oil companies would not speculate on possible increases at the pumps, but conceded that price rises were ineitable if the price of crude continued to spiral. Petrol Retailers' Association spokesman Ray Holloway said rises would follow "quite quickly" if the present high oil price continues - which would in turn depend on what the next few days bring in the Middle East. A BP spokesman said prices probably would go up because the raw material had gone up - no-one knew how much and when. Road Haulage Association national chairman John Bridge said the price of crude oil was only a side issue, and called on the Government to reduce taxes on petrol and diesel.  By ANDREA BABBINGTON
