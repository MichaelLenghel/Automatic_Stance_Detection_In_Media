Anyone interested in the Middle East and human rights may make a date to attend 'Gaza - An Irish Response'. St Aidan's cathedral curate Father Billy Swann will give an account of his first hand knowledge of the situation in Gaza at the Riverside Park hotel in Enniscorthy on Tuesday, December 9 at 8 p.m. The session is hosted by Ferns CAFÉ (Catholic Adult Formation and Education), a newly formed group of adults who meet monthly to discuss and reflect upon their Christian faith in the modern world.
