NEARLY 300 new jobs are to be created after announcements by two separate firms. Supermarket giant Tesco will today create 266 jobs with the opening of a new store in Naas, Co Kildare, while 20 jobs are to be created at Bioshell Teo, a healthcare manufacturing company in Co Mayo that produces vitamin and mineral-supplement products. The latest Tesco store opening is part of a €133m investment plan announced by the company earlier this year to create 748 new jobs across the country. The news comes as a group of Irish companies head to the Middle East on a week-long trip to land export deals and secure more new jobs at home. Enterprise Minister Batt O'Keeffe is leading a trade mission of 45 homegrown firms and banking representatives to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. "We will use this trade mission to help Irish firms land deals with companies in the Middle East and showcase the innovative products and services produced by our indigenous enterprises," he said.
