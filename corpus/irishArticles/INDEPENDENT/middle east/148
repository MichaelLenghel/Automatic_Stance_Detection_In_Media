Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has scrapped plans for warm-weather training in the Middle East during the Premier League winter break, with concerns over political tensions in the region. The Manchester United manager had earmarked the 16-day gap in fixtures for a training camp in Qatar or Dubai, but he will now work on his players closer to home - in Europe. "There are other things that worry me more than football," Solskjaer said. "We were looking at the Middle East, but that is definitely not going to happen." His team face Wolverhampton Wanderers in their FA Cup replay tonight, with Solskjaer welcoming next month's break as he is already concerned about the amount of games his young side are playing. Tonight's fixture will be United's 11th in 35 days. © Daily Telegraph, London Telegraph.co.uk
