The US should pack up and leave the Middle East and stay out of regional affairs, Iran's president said during a visit to Damascus that follows a string of US efforts to break up Syria's 30-year alliance with Tehran. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Arab nations will usher in a new Middle East "without Zionists and without colonialists." "(The Americans) want to dominate the region but they feel Iran and Syria are preventing that," Ahmadinejad said during a news conference with Syrian President Bashar Assad. "We tell them that instead of interfering in the region's affairs, to pack their things and leave." A string of high-profile visits to Damascus in recent months - from the US, France, and now Iran - shows Syria's strategic importance in the Middle East. US President Barack Obama is determined to engage with Syria, a country seen as key to peace in the region but which the State Department has long considered a state sponsor of terrorism. Ahmadinejad's trip comes amid rising US tension with Tehran over the country's nuclear programme. The US and others believe Iran is hiding nuclear weapons development under the guise of a civilian energy program. Iran insists that its intentions are peaceful. On Thursday, Assad signalled his strong support for Iran, saying America's stance on Iran "is a new situation of colonialism in the region." Still, Assad could be open to a breakthrough with the Americans. He is hoping for US help in boosting a weak economy and for American mediation in direct peace talks with Israel - a recognition that he needs American involvement to achieve his top goal of winning the return of the Golan Heights, seized by Israel in the 1967 war.
