The Archbishop of Canterbury has said he will be praying for US President Donald Trump to have the "determination and courage" to push for peace between Israel and the Palestinians during his upcoming trip to the region. The Most Rev Justin Welby, speaking as he wrapped up a 10-day trip to the Holy Land, said that his key takeaway from the visit was "the overwhelming need for peace". The head of the Church of England said that "people have lots of views about President Trump but when he comes here, my prayer for him is that he will be filled with determination and courage and given gifts of wisdom that will make a difference". Mr Welby also urged politicians to make peace their main goal, both between Israel and the Palestinians and across the Middle East. AP PA Media
