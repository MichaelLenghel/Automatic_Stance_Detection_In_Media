Snow has covered the highlands of northwest Saudi Arabia as the Middle East continues to be hit by the heaviest snowfall in decades. While for many, the rare occurrence has caused major disruption in countries that are ill prepared for extreme winter weather, others have found novel ways to enjoy the white stuff, as well as make the world laugh. In a video posted by Mohammed Alobaidan titled ‘this why we don’t have snow in Saudi Arabia’, Mr Alobaidan and a friend have done just that. The clip, apparently filmed in the rocky highlands of the country, shows a Saudi man running up to a large mound of snow, diving into it face first and burying his entire head. Capturing, the fun that winter can bring in just six seconds, the feel good clip has since been viewed nearly 300,000 times on Youtube. Accompanying the video, Mr Alobaidan added just one short humorous comment: “While the Darwin theory of evolution saying that the humans came from monkeys , I say that us (Saudis) came from ostriches.” Independent News Service
