SPRING water from a source on the side of a Co Clare mountain discovered by a water diviner's coathanger is on its way to being sold across the Middle East. This follows Clare Spring Water Ltd signing a deal to export to the Middle East through a recently-established Bahraini food import firm, Bahsham. The Co Clare-born director of Bahsham, Tom Byrne, said yesterday that the firm intends to distribute Clare Spring water across the Middle East, targeting festivals, and will be also aiming to sell its product to the US navy fifth fleet based in Bahrain. Clare Spring opened four years ago and only came about after water diviner, Cllr PJ Kelly, detected the water source with the aid of a metal coathanger. This led to a €4m windfall for the Clare village of Lissy-casey and the creation of 15 jobs. Our picture shows Adel Al Sammak of Basham Food Imports with Cllr Kelly and Paul Connellan, Clare Spring Water's managing director. Cllr Kelly said he is "delighted" with the company's Bahsham deal. Mr Connellan said the deal has the potential for Clare Spring Water to increase its workforce by one-third, or five full-time positions. He added: "The first order with Bahsham is for 25,000 litres and Bahsham are confident they will be ordering two loads of 25,000 litres of water per month." Currently, 250,000 litres are bottled each week at the Clare plant for BWG and Dunnes Stores deals. Mr Connellan said: "We are over the moon about the brand being sold in the Middle East. For a small start-up firm to be exporting to the Middle East is an incredible achievement."  Indo Business
