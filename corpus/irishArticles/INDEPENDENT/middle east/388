The closure of US embassies across the Middle East was prompted by the intercept of unusual communication between al-Qaeda's leader and the head of its Yemen affiliate, it emerged last night.  America also issued a worldwide travel alert last night after warning of an al-Qa'ida plot to attack public transport or tourist sites. The US State Department said the risk of a terror attack was particularly high in the Middle East and North Africa until the end of August. It follows a warning from America on Thursday of a plot to attack its embassies in Muslim countries. US authorities have ordered the closure of their embassies around the world tomorrow as a precaution. However, in the case of the embassy in Dublin, the building is usually closed to the public on Sundays anyway. The embassy would not say whether any additional security measures were being put in place. US State Department officials said American citizens overseas should be aware of a potential al-Qa'ida attack either in or emanating from the Arabian peninsula. The attacks "may involve public transportation systems and other tourist infrastructure". General Martin Dempsey, the most senior US military officer, said the threat was against western interests, not just the US. Terrorism experts said Islamic extremists view tomorrow as an auspicious day to target Westerners as it falls on the Laylat al-Qadr, the day when the Koran was revealed to the Prophet Mohammad. Ayman al-Zawahiri, leader of al-Qa'ida, released a tape on Wednesday encouraging attacks on US interests in the Middle East in retaliation for America holding high-profile prisoners from the terrorist group.
