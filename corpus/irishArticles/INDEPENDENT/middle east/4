The Middle East claimed a double at the inaugural Etihad GAA World Games winning both the men's and women's competition in Abu Dhabi. After an entertaining two day tournament that drew teams from all over the globe, the men's final was an all-Middle East affair with the region's second team trumping the first side in the final. In the process, they overturned a two point defeat to the same opposition from earlier in the competition. Both teams fielded some well-known players. Peter Domican, who captained Roscommon to a Connacht title in 2010, was on the winners' team that was skippered by Meath's Joe Melia. The losers included Wexford's Aindreas Doyle as well as former Kerry U21 Cian Tobin, who starred in the decider, hitting 1-7. However, Darren Kelly's goal turned the tie in the second team's favour, with the sides level when he found the net midway through the second half. From there they ran out convincing winners with Conor Smith bagging a fourth goal with the last play of the game to seal a 4-13 to 1-16 win. The ladies final saw the Middle East side overturn a half-time deficit and grind their way past a brave Australasia side.
