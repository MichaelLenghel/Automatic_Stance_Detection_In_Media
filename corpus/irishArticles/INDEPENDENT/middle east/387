Outgoing British Prime Minister Tony Blair is set to accept the post of Middle East peace envoy, according to the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern. Media reports in recent days has repeatedly suggested that Mr Blair will be appointed as an envoy to the so-called Quartet overseeing efforts to achieve peace between the Israelis and Palestinians. Some commentators say Mr Blair is completely unsuitable for the job given his role in the US/British invasion of Iraq. However, in a radio interview this morning, Mr Ahern says he spoke to the outgoing British leader last Friday and he confirmed that he was going to take the job. The Taoiseach said Mr Blair hoped to repeat the success of the Irish peace process in the Middle East by engaging directly with the parties in a determined and persistent manner.
