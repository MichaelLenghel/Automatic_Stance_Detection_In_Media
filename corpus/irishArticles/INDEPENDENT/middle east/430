A marathon Middle East peace summit called to resolve 52 years of IsraeliPalestinian conflict came back from the dead in the early hours this morning after the White House announced it had ended in failure. News update, 20/07/00, 9.05am U.S. President Bill Clinton said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat had agreed to remain at Camp David and continue talking while he makes a three–day trip to Japan for a Group of Eight nations summit. "We all thought it was over, and then we discovered that nobody want to go, that nobody wanted to give up." said an exhausted and emotional Mr Clinton, summing up a nine–day roller–coaster ride that came close to total breakdown over the crucial issue of Jerusalem. Clinton, who invested much of his remaining prestige and persuasive powers in trying to broker a deal, said the leaders would continue negotiations under the auspices of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright while he was away, and he would assess progress when he returned from Japan. "The gaps remain substantial but there has been progress and we must all be prepared to go the extra mile." Clinton said. "There should be no illusion about the difficult task ahead. This is really, really hard."
