The Taoiseach today met with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Salman, as he continues a five day visit the country and the neighbouring Gulf states. Enda Kenny and the Minister for Jobs and Enterprise Richard Bruton met the Saudi prince, who is the country's deputy premier and minister for defence as well as a senior member of the Saudi ruling family, at a royal palace in the capital Riyadh. Trade, including Ireland's push to boost business links with Saudi Arabia and ultimately to drive an increase in Irish exports of goods and services to the Middle East, is understood to have been at the top of the Irish agenda for the discussions.  The economic recovery at home and exit from the bailout and the wider economic situation in the euro zone as well as the situation in Syria, which borders Saudi Arabia, are also likely to be on the agenda.  Earlier, the Rehab Group signed a €2.3m contract to provide training and support services to local agency the Human Resources Development Fund (HRDF), which works with people with disabilities.
