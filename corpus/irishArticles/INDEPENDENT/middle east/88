Embarrassment is surely the reason middle names are given. Few children with amusing or unusual names squeezed between first and surname escape the wrath of the school ground jokers (this particular writer included). Yesterday the 25-man squad lists for every Premier League team were issued and with it a few interesting middle names came to light. It would be safe to assume that Philip Nikodem Jagielka is the brunt of a few jokes at the England training camp whilst QPR midfielder Jordon James Edward Sydney Mutch is unlikely to escape a ribbing when the team gather again after the international break. Here, we've selected our favourite 10 from the Premier League... 1. Jagielka, Philip Nikodem The England defender could have represented Poland, through his grandfather from whom he takes his middle name.

Richards, Ashley Darel Jazz The Swansea midfielder's middle name is arguably more cool than it is embarrassing. 3. Welbeck, Daniel Nii Tackie Mensah Arsenal's latest signing would have fitted in better at Tiki-Taka playing Barcelona with that middle name.
