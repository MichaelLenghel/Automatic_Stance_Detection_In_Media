A GROUP of Kerry men living across the Gulf region are to showcase their GAA expertise this week as they take part in the GAA World Games Tournament in Abu Dhabi. The Middle East Kerry Society was founded in 2011 by a group of GAA-mad Kerry exiles specifically so they could enter a local GAA tournament, as well as keeping the lads from home together, provide a network and a bit of banter away from home.  For one tournament per year the lads step away from their respective UAE clubs:  Dubai Celts/Abu Dhabi Na Fianna/ Arabian Celts/ Qatar/ Oman GAA - to band together and play their own clubmen in a competition full of  fierce rivalry and good fun too.  This week, the group will enter the GAA World Games Tournament which takes place from March 5-7 where they will compete with teams New York, North America, Asia, Middle East and Canada to name a few. Given the number of players involved (over 30) and the cross section of clubs represented, there is even a possibility that there will be two teams entered. The lads have their own Facebook -Middle-East-Kerry-Society - where they have released a video promo for the World Games so be sure to log on, send them best wishes and of course keep up to date on their progress.
