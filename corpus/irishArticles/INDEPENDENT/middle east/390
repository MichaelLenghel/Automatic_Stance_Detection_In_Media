POPE Benedict XVI today appealed for an immediate ceasefire in the Middle East to end a crisis he described as "ever more tragic". "In the name of God, I appeal to all those responsible for this spiral of violence, so that they immediately put down their arms on all sides," the pope told faithful at Castel Gandolfo, his summer residence outside Rome. POPE Benedict XVI today appealed for an immediate ceasefire in the Middle East to end a crisis he described as "ever more tragic". "In the name of God, I appeal to all those responsible for this spiral of violence, so that they immediately put down their arms on all sides," the pope told faithful at Castel Gandolfo, his summer residence on the outskirts of Rome. Pausing slightly, he stressed the word "immediately". "I appeal to governing leaders and to international institutions not to spare any effort to obtain this necessary cessation of hostilities and to be able to begin to construct, through dialogue, a lasting and stable coexistence of all the peoples of the Middle East," he said. "In this moment I cannot help but think of the situation, ever more grave and more tragic, that the Middle East is going through: hundreds of dead, so many wounded, a huge number of the homeless and refugees, houses, cities and infrastructure destroyed, while in the hearts of many, hate and the will for revenge seem to grow," he added. Meanwhile, Irish bishops condemned the Israeli bombardment of Lebanon. The Irish Catholic Bishop's Commission for Justice and Social Affairs (ICJS) said in a statement yesterday that Hizbollah and its supporters were the aggressors in the current conflict, but said Israel's response was "unacceptable. The recourse to what amounts to war against a sovereign country in response to terrorists attacks can never be justified."
