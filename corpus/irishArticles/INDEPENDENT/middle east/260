Tony Blair has submitted his resignation as Middle East peace envoy, an official has said. Mr Blair is to step down as after eight years in the role. The former prime minister of Britain will quit the role - which he took up immediately after leaving Downing Street in 2007 - next month. Sources said that, although Mr Blair will no longer represent the group of the UN, the US, the EU and Russia, he plans to remain "active on the issues". Officials in Jerusalem said Mr Blair had written a letter to United Nations chief Ban Ki-moon to confirm his resignation. When he took the position he was put in charge of helping develop the Palestinian economy and institutions. But he struggled in the position, and one official said there had been "frustration" over his limited authorities. PA Media
