George Bush and Tony Blair last night launched a diplomatic initiative to try to end the conflict in the Middle East. They agreed that US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice would fly back to the region today in an attempt to persuade the Lebanese and Israeli governments to agree on a peace plan. US President George Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair last night launched a fresh diplomatic initiative to try to end the conflict in the Middle East as they shrugged off criticism of their record in the crisis. At an emergency summit in the White House, they agreed that US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice would fly back to the region today in an attempt to persuade the Lebanese and Israeli governments to agree on a peace plan and the deployment of an international force on their border. Mr Blair said world powers would meet at the UN on Monday to thrash out a resolution authorising a "stabilisation force". The announcement came on the 17th day of the crisis that has claimed the lives of more than 400 people, mainly civilians, in Lebanon, and 51 Israelis, mainly soldiers. America and Britain have faced widespread criticism in Europe and the Middle East for their refusal to call for an immediate ceasefire. The Israelis interpreted that as a green light to continue their offensive in southern Lebanon. Following the failure of the peace talks in Rome on Wednesday, Mr Bush and Mr Blair emerged from an hour and half's meeting in the White House keen to show their determination to breathe life into the diplomacy. They made clear they wanted a force dispatched to the region "quickly". But any deal must bring a long-term solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. Mr Bush said that tackling terrorists intent on stopping the spread of democracy and freedom in the Middle East was the "battle of the 21st century".
