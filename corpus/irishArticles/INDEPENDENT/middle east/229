Royal Bank of Scotland, the UK's largest taxpayer-owned bank and the parent of Ulster Bank, is weighing the sale of its Middle East corporate-loan book as it reviews its international business, sources said. The bank is working with PwC on the sale and has already contacted potential buyers. RBS chief executive Ross McEwan has been cutting back investment-banking operations and focusing on domestic customers to reverse six straight years of losses. The bank said in August that it's considering selling the international arm of its Coutts private bank to focus on wealthy UK clients. RBS has dismissed most of its team overseeing debt-capital markets in central and eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa. The dismissals were also part of the review of the bank's operations outside the UK, sources said. Standard Chartered recently abandoned a plan to sell about $400m (€321m) of small and medium-sized corporate loans in the United Arab Emirates. "Part of the strategy set out by RBS chief Ross McEwan in February was to make RBS a smaller, simpler and more UK-centric bank, focusing on where our customers need us most," RBS said in a statement through a Dubai-based spokeswoman. "We are looking at options across our CEEMEA network, but no decisions have been taken. "It is business as usual and we remain committed to serving our customers in the region." Indo Business
