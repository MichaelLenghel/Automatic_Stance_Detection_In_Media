Solar AdTek, which develops solar-powered and LED lighting systems for outdoor advertising, has signed a deal with Dubai-based Poweregion to bring its solar lighting systems to a bigger market.  Poweregion's customers are based in the Middle East and Africa region, and the group has over 1,000 clients. Under the agreement with Solar AdTek, Poweregion will be now in a position to offer an extended range of services to its customers. Solar AdTek CEO Eoin O'Broin said that the company was "delighted" to be  extending its international footprint to the Middle East and Africa. "In Poweregion, we have found the optimum channel partner, whose business is clearly strategically aligned with ours," Mr O'Broin added. "The agreement will enable us to bring our solar and energy-saving LED lighting technologies to a wide market and we are confident that it will be of significant mutual benefit to both of our companies." Projects completed in Ireland in 2018 by Solar AdTek include the upgrading of the lighting in advertising displays across CIE's Out of Home advertising estate on the national rail network. It has also worked on the upgrade of 1,800 bus shelter units across Ireland with JCDecaux, decreasing its carbon emissions. The company operates in 12 countries globally. Irish Independent
