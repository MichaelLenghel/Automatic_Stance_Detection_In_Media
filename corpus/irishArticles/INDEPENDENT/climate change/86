Fingal County Council is to bring forward a comprehensive Climate Action Plan in early 2019 in order to meet the challenges of climate change. Fingal County Council is in the process of bringing forward its Climate Change Action Plan, which is expected to be brought before councillors this month before going out for public consultation. Climate adaptation and mitigation actions have been grouped together into five key areas in the Climate Change Action Plan, which has now been published as a joint initiative by the four Dublin Local Authorities. Climate Change is one of the most pressing challenges facing governments today and Fingal County Council has put it at the forefront of its agenda, as it strives to reduce the impacts of climate change. The Plan has already been presented to the Council's Environmental Strategic Policy Committee. Chief Executive Paul Reid said:  'Fingal County Council's Climate Change Action Plan sets out how the Council will improve energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in its own buildings and operations, while endeavouring to make Fingal a more climate resilient region, with engaged and informed citizens.' He added: 'Fingal County Council will continue to work with key stakeholders to influence and support carbon reduction initiatives across the county's transport, commercial and residential sectors.' Mayor of Fingal Cllr Anthony Lavin said: 'The Fingal County Council Climate Change Action Plan will help to make Fingal climate-resilient and protect its critical infrastructure by reducing the impacts of current and future climate change-related events and by working in close collaboration with the other Dublin Local Authorities, regional authorities and national bodies.' He added: 'We look forward to working with the newly established Dublin Metropolitan Climate Action Regional Office, which will ensure that that overall plan is fully updated every five years to reflect latest policy, technology and climate and climate related impacts.'
