Thousands of people have joined a march and rally in Paris as part of an international mobilisation to show popular support for urgent measures to combat climate change. Crowds overflowed a square in front of City Hall before marching east to the Place de la Republique on Saturday. They carried with them a message that it is up to the public to put global warming at the top of the political agenda. The front page of France’s daily Liberation newspaper featured a call from 700 French scientists for politicians to take action because “solutions are available”. Activists encouraged Rise For Climate protests around the world before a climate summit opens next week in San Francisco. California’s governor proposed the event after President Donald Trump withdrew the US from the Paris climate agreement. PA Media
