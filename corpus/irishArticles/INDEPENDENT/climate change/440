The BBC is planning to introduce a host of new programmes exploring the impact of climate change. In what the corporation describes as “its most ambitious year” of covering the topic, the BBC will broadcast documentaries, podcasts and debates under the Our Planet Matters banner. It said the programmes will explore all aspects of the environment “at a local and global level” with Sir David Attenborough among those getting involved.

Sir David will warn that “the moment of crisis has come” in an interview with BBC News while the revered naturalist will also present a one-hour documentary, Extinction: The Facts. Springwatch host Chris Packham will investigate the impact of the planet’s growing population in 7.7 Billion People And Counting on BBC Two. The BBC also said it is stepping up its commitment towards going carbon neutral. PA Media
