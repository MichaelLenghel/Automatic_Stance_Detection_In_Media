Danny Healy-Rae has strongly rejected that Hurricane Ophelia is a result of climate change.  The Kerry TD made national headlines last year when he said in a Dáil debate that, "God above is in charge of the weather and we here can’t do anything about it".  Now as Ophelia exhibits her force throughout the country, the Independent TD is adamant that it is in no way linked to global warming.   "I've talked a lot about my views on climate change in the past and I stand by them," he told Independent.ie  "There have always been different weather patterns with big storms equivalent to [Ophelia] recorded over the years.   "I personally don't believe in climate change and don't think the burning of fossil fuels has any effect on our climate.   "During the notorious storm [in 1839], we didn't have all the machinery, factories or livestock that we have today.   "While that particular storm had a devastating impact in this country, you certainly couldn't say that climate change played a part," he said.   The Kerry representative added that he believes scientists use climate change as a "money-making" tactic.   "All over the world they are making enormous money from climate change," he said.   "They're getting millions out of fear mongering. Many scientists – even half of them – don't even believe in climate change.  "I have raised this issue going way back and there are plenty of people who agree with my stance."  Mr Healy-Rae said he hopes no one loses their life during the Hurricane Ophelia and encourages everyone to stay "as safe as possible".  Online Editors
