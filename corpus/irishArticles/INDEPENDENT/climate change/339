Environmental activist Greta Thunberg furiously attacked world leaders at the UN for not doing more to tackle climate change, berating the delegates with: "How dare you!" Ms Thunberg (16), who began the "climate strike" movement, also launched legal proceedings against five countries, arguing they did not prevent climate change despite knowing the damage it caused. Yesterday, she addressed the UN and demanded action: "You come to us young people for hope - how dare you!" she said. "You have stolen my dreams, my childhood, with your empty words.  "People are suffering, people are dying, entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and the fairytale of endless economic growth. How dare you?  "How dare you continue to look away, and come here saying that you are doing enough, when the politics and solutions needed are still nowhere in sight?"  Irish Independent
