COULD you be a climate ambassador? The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Cool Planet Experience are looking for 26 members of the public to become a climate change advocate and help drive change in their counties. Cool Planet Experience (CPE), which due to open early next year and which is a media partner of Independent.ie, is an interactive  visitor experience on climate change located at the Powerscourt Estate in Co Wicklow. It aims to highlight the urgency of tackling climate change, and the Cool Planet Champions programme will provide training in communications skills. In return, champions are expected to give ten climate talks in their county, to schools, business or the general public. Chief Climate Scientist at the EPA, Frank McGovern, said that general knowledge on climate change was relatively low in Ireland, which the initiative aimed to address. “General knowledge on climate change and an understanding of our individual roles in making the transition to low carbon are relatively low in Ireland, due to a lack of funding and discussion about these topics,” he said. “Sometimes when the topic is covered, it is done in a way that people feel is over their heads, with jargon and complicated messages on climate action instead of communicating it in an easily accessible and relatable fashion. “Through its partnership with the EPA, the Cool Planet Champions programme is aimed at filling the gap in communication with the general public, through local advocates rather than a roving corporate style team.” Applications can be made by sending a short two-minute video explaining who you are and why you would make a great Cool Planet Champion to philipsmyth@coolplanet.ie by September 22.
