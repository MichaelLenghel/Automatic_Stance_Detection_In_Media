The Swedish teenager who has sparked a youth-driven push for action on climate change has taken part in a protest in Washington. Greta Thunberg joined about 1,500 protesters, many of them schoolchildren, who marched and chanted near the White House. The 16-year-old has gained international attention by inspiring protests and school strikes demanding immediate action to avert environmental catastrophe. Her activism has drawn a passionate following of children challenging their elders to take action.
