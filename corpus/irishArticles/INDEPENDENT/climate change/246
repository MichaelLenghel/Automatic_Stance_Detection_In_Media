Greta's father Svante was also on the boat as it approached the Lisbon quayside. Chile's environment minister Carolina Schmidt, saluted Greta's role speaking out about the threat of climate change. "She has been a leader that has been able to move and open hearts for many young people and many people all over the world," Ms Schmidt said at the summit in Madrid. "We need that tremendous force in order to increase climate action."

She wanted a low-carbon form of transport to get to the climate meeting, which was switched at short notice to Spain from Chile due to unrest there.

Meanwhile, a report by the UN weather agency released on the sidelines of the climate talks found that the current decade is likely to set a new 10-year temperature record.

REUTERS/Rafael Marchante REUTERS / Preliminary temperature measurements show that the years from 2015 to 2019 and from 2010 to 2019 "are, respectively, almost certain to be the warmest five-year period and decade on record", the World Meteorological Organisation said. "Since the 1980s, each successive decade has been warmer than the last," the agency added. While full-year figures are not released until March, 2019 is also expected to be the second or third warmest year since measurements began, with 2016 still holding the record, it said. This year was hotter than average in most parts of the world, including the Arctic. "In contrast a large area of North America has been colder than the recent average," the UN said. The World Meteorological Organisation's annual report, which brings together data from numerous national weather agencies and research organisations, also highlighted the impacts of climate change including declining sea ice and rising sea levels, which reached their highest level this year since high-precision measurements began in 1993.
