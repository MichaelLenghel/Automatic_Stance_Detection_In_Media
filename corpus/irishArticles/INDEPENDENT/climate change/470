Climate change is a hoax led by the United Nations so that it can end democracy, claims Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott's chief business adviser. Maurice Newman, the chairman of Australia’s business advisory council, has written that scientific modelling showing the link between humans and climate change is wrong and the real agenda is a world takeover for the UN.    Mr Newman said the science showing links between human activity and the warming climate was being used as a “hook” by the UN to expand its global control. “This is not about facts or logic. It’s about a new world order under the control of the UN,” he wrote in an editorial in The Australian newspaper.   “It is opposed to capitalism and freedom and has made environmental catastrophism a household topic to achieve its objective.”  Mr Newman, a staunch conservative, has long been an outspoken critic of climate change science.

 / In his piece, he said the world has been “subjected to extravagance from climate catastrophists for close to 50 years”. “It’s a well-kept secret, but 95 per cent of the climate models we are told prove the link between human CO2 emissions and catastrophic global warming have been found, after nearly two decades of temperature stasis, to be in error,” he wrote. “The real agenda is concentrated political authority. Global warming is the hook. Eco-catastrophists… have captured the UN and are extremely well funded. They have a hugely powerful ally in the White House.”    The 77-year-old was appointed chairman of the government’s business advisory council by Mr Abbott, who himself is something of a climate change sceptic and once famously described climate change as “absolute crap”.
