Households won't get a cheque in the post to offset the cost of carbon tax increases after the Budget, Taosieach Leo Varadkar has confirmed. Mr Varadkar is to tell the UN Climate Action Summit that Ireland its to ring-fence the funds raised by carbon tax hikes for efforts to fight climate change and help people who may be impacted by the move away from fossil fuels. However, he confirmed that the government does not plan to return these revenues to households in the form of a dividend cheque as had previously been mooted. Mr Varadkar will also also tell other world leaders that exploration for oil in Irish Waters is to be ended. Starting his five-day mission to the United States Mr Varadkar rejected suggestions from Solidarity TD Ruth Coppinger that his efforts at the UN this week amount to "showboating". In his speech to the UN he will also outline how any extra money raised from carbon tax "will be ploughed back into climate action".
