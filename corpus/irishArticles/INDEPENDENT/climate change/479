To add a comment to Neil Foster's opinion on climate change (Letters, October 1), the sun is not in fact the sole cause of climate change and has not been "controlling climate change as long as this planet existed". Other forces have just as big an impact as the heating effect of the sun, such as the salt levels of the sea or the earth's ability to absorb the hideous amounts of carbon dioxide we produce. Climate change isn't a result of the sun burning us out of it, but more a result of the ozone layer's depletion and the heating effect caused by the atmosphere's inability to rid us of the reflected heat from the sun, which actually causes the heating effect resulting in climate change. It is preposterous to think that the ice caps are increasing in size when the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change has shown clear evidence that they are in fact shrinking. Opinions like these allow a lot of people to continue believing that climate change does not exist and to continue destroying our planet through greed and ignorance.  Alan Fitzsimons
