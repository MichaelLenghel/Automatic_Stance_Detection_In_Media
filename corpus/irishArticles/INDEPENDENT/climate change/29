Hundreds of thousands of people around the world are joining demonstrations calling for action to tackle climate change. Here are some of the latest protests from the “global climate strike”. – Australia Some of the first rallies were held in Australia’s largest city, Sydney, and the national capital, Canberra.

The protesters staged a “die-in” outside the ministry to dramatise their concerns, lying down on the pavement with many clutching home-made signs with slogans such as “Clean air is our right”. – India Dozens of students and environmental activists gathered in the capital demanding immediate action.

 (Czarek Sokolowski/AP) AP/PA Images / Critics say the government is dragging its feet on its programme of subsidies for families who do away with coal-burning heaters that are largely responsible for smog, especially in southern regions. A coal-producing nation with tens of thousands of jobs in mining, Poland gets 80% of its energy from fossil fuels. The government’s plan for phasing coal out is slow paced, reaching to 2050. – Africa Banners in Kenya’s capital Nairobi ranged from angry to playful, with one reading: “This planet is getting hotter than my imaginary boyfriend.”

Hundreds of people gathered in Johannesburg chanted and waved signs saying “Climate justice now” and “There’s only one Earth”. Experts say Africa is the most vulnerable continent to climate change and the least equipped to deal with it. Governments have pleaded for more support from the international community. Residents of Africa’s most populous city, Lagos in Nigeria, joined the demonstrations. Environmentalist Desmond Majekodunmi said for the first time all of humanity faces a threat to their very existence, “so the only way we can overcome that problem is by coming together, forgetting our differences”. – Afghanistan About 100 young people, with several young women in the front carrying a banner emblazoned with “Fridays for future”, marched through central Kabul, following an armoured personnel carrier deployed for their protection as well as half a dozen army personnel behind them and along the route.

 (Ebrahim Noroozi/AP) AP/PA Images / Fardeen Barakzai, one of the organisers and head of the local climate group called Oxygen, said: “We want to do our part. We as the youth of our country know the problem of climate change. We know war can kill a group of people… the problem in Afghanistan is our leaders are fighting for power but the real power is in nature.” – Czech Republic Thousands of students gathered in the Old Town Square in Prague, waving banners that read “More love, less coal”, “Science, not silence” and “Why should we go to universities when they don’t listen to the educated?” before marching through the city. Organisers say rallies are taking place in about 40 places across the country.

Some held banners that read: “Save the World” and “Our home is burning!” Several hundred young people gathered in Split, on Croatia’s Adriatic Sea coast, carrying a huge banner that urged, “Split, wake up!” Activists warned Split could face flooding due to global warming. Dozens of people also marched through Serbia’s capital Belgrade and in Montenegro’s capital Podgorica. Mexico Hundreds of mainly young demonstrators marched through Mexico City, chanting “political change, not climate change!” That was an apparent reference to President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s push to increase production and processing of fossil fuels. The mainly youthful crowd at Friday’s protest suggested young people were taking the lead on the issue. High school student Maria Martinez carried a sign that read: “You’ll die of old age; I’ll die of climate change.” PA Media
