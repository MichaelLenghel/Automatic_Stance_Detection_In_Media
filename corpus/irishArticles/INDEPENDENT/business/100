Madeleine Albright's immortal quote – "There's a special place in hell for women who don't help other women" – appears to be everywhere of late. Even country-pop princess Taylor Swift has been moved to cite it recently. Certainly, global enterprise and the sisterhood was thrown into sharp focus last year when Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer made various statements about sleeping under her desk at Yahoo, banning telecommuting for her employees and taking only a few weeks for maternity leave. While Mayer never claimed to be representative of other women, 'Forbes' promptly ran a damming opinion piece asking, "Should you hate Marissa Mayer?" Paradoxically, seven of the world's top companies have an above average number of women at board level (an average of 22.7pc female board members – the average is 19pc across FTSE100 firms). Yet, as Mayer proves, when it comes to workplace equality and stamping out double standards, we still have a way to go. On the flipside, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg released her book 'Lean In: Women, Work & The Will To Lead' last year. The book, urging women to crash through the glass ceiling while acknowledging the leadership ambition gap between males and females, polarised opinion, but there was little doubting that it put the spotlight back on the complex narrative about women in the workplace. Sandberg is no stranger to grand statements either: she recently bemoaned the fact that so few women stay in business once they have a child, and boldly proclaimed that the most important career decision a woman will make is the man she'll marry. Regardless, her bestseller spawned the 'Lean In' movement, encouraging women to achieve their professional and personal goals by 'leaning' into their ambitions and exchanging ideas and information with other women. Closer to home, a group of female entrepreneurs were doing just that long before Sandberg invoked her battle cry. Going for Growth, in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland and the Equality For Women Measure, is a peer-led initiative that matches female entrepreneurs – more than 160 to date – with others further along in their careers. Through roundtable discussions, these women support each other by looking at challenges, opportunities and ways to grow and expand their businesses. As women, we are beginning to realise that the opportunities for success are less than finite; in taking our own piece of the proverbial cake, we are not denying anyone else their share. In fact, the field is pretty wide open. A recent report about Irish entrepreneurs revealed that only 10pc of high-potential start-ups backed by Enterprise Ireland were woman-led enterprises. Elsewhere, several US researchers have documented the advent of "queen bee syndrome", which is used to denote a woman in power who refuses to help other women, and treats subordinates more critically if they're female. Yet, female entrepreneurs in Ireland are largely unfamiliar with the term, much less the concept. Going for Growth is the brainchild of Paula Fitzsimons, who initially turned down the opportunity to champion women's entrepreneurship at an earlier point in her career. "At the time, my focus was on enterprise and growth, but when I saw the research, and the gap that was there, I felt someone had to do something," she explains. "I'm involved in the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, and research showed in 2002 that fewer women than men started businesses. A year or two later I began to interrogate the (updated) figures. While we say that two-and-a-half times more men than women set up businesses, the research showed that nine times more men wanted to grow their businesses. It was clear that there was a gap that no one was addressing. "At these events it's not, 'Rah-rah, aren't we great?', it's about building confidence through achievement. The great thing is that women have become more believing of their potential and focused on business growth and on tackling international markets." While Irish female business owners are enjoying something of a purple patch, the same issues appear to be pertinent for all of them. Some of them cite the hangover from the previous generation, where women were urged to leave the workforce upon getting married, while others contend that maternity leave can disrupt the momentum or the upward trajectory in a woman's career. Speaking to the women behind some of Ireland's most dynamic businesses, it's clear that the work-life balance is still an evergreen concern – by dint of sheer social conditioning, mothers are rather often the first ports of call when it comes to parenting duties. Grandparents who fill in as childminders have become an invaluable resource for many working families, but there's still a sentiment that there is room for improvement when it comes to formal childcare arrangements and the creation of shared parental leave (which will come into effect in the UK from 2015). For now, however, good peer pressure from women in similar spheres is not just an asset, according to Paula, it's the lifeblood of many businesswomen. The cliche still holds firm – there is strength in numbers.   Paula Fitzsimons is the founder and director of Going for Growth, and the founder and MD for Fitzsimons Consulting (Fitzsimons-consulting.ie), which specialises in areas related to entrepreneurship and growth. I've long known the power of role models. A man with a good role model is twice as likely to succeed in business, while a woman with a role model is four or five times more likely to succeed. I worked in the IDA back in the day, and my mentors would have been men, as there were no more senior women than I was at the time. When it comes to applying for jobs, women won't go for a job unless they tick every box, while many men will go in with half the job requirements. With women, it's definitely a confidence thing. The best advice I ever got was that if you can dream it, you can do it. Allow the dreams to be high enough – getting there is a question of patience and persistence. Keep the customer at the centre of what you do, and don't forget to stand back and take a view of the road ahead every so often.

 Paula Fitzsimons  /   Anne Cusack is the founder and MD of Critical Healthcare (Criticalhealth care.com) in Westmeath, a company that supplies medical goods and services to emergency services. I've been very fortunate in that I had two female managers very early on in my career who were very professional and fantastic in the way they worked and balanced their family lives. Usually, women have to drop things when they get the call from schools. My husband is extremely supportive, but maybe it's a guilt thing for me that I try and take on more and do a little more for the children – you work later on in the evening because you want to take them to music class. When I gave birth, I didn't take maternity leave. It wasn't an issue for me, you want to grow your business as it's like another baby. When my husband had a serious accident in 2003, just as my third child was being born, people were like, "I'm assuming you'll close down the business". I was like, "You must be joking". It was then more than ever that I needed it.

 Anne Cusack  /   Susan Spence is the executive chairwoman and co-founder of Dublin-based software company SoftCo (Softco.com). She has been a lead entrepreneur for Going for Growth and is a member of the Government Enterprise Advisory Group. When I was going to school, there were limited opportunities for women who wanted to get into computers, but I've certainly noticed a change in that there are more women coders around. It's a great development. I recently read Sheryl Sandberg's book, and even though she got criticised I agreed with everything that she said. She talked a lot about women helping each other out, and that's a great dialogue to have out there. She was very self-effacing and prepared to be very honest in her views. I've noticed with the women that I've encountered that they're good at saying, "I'm not that good at doing this. How do I get over this?" Would men put their hand on their hearts and show the same level of honesty?   Ceara McNeela is the owner of engineering firm Asgard Industrial Systems (Aisl.ie) in Maynooth. My mum was a huge influence growing up as she owned her own businesses and won an award for female entrepreneurship in the early 1980s. She achieved great balance – I never felt anything but the top priority for her. Child-minding is something that every woman in business struggles with, but I would say that my mother running a business was incredibly positive for my childhood. It gave me a value of money and a work ethic. I remember being mentored by Elaine Coughlan (founder of Atlantic Bridge). Her lasting advice was, "You have to think big". This resonates in my head the whole time. Women can be more cautious when it comes to their expectations, and I'd put that down to realism. Yet, surrounding yourself with other women encourages you that it can be done.

 Ceara McNeela  / Mary McKenna is the MD of Dublin-based travel company Tour America (Touramerica.ie) and the recently launched Cruise Holidays. She has also been a lead entrepreneur for Going for Growth. In business, women are good at multitasking. We also have a lot of empathy and common sense – emotional intelligence is crucial for business. When I'm hiring staff and managers, I look at how they connect with customers and staff. The big thing I've learned is that you can't drive a business without loving and caring for yourself. I had to skip a few things and work very hard down the years, but it's important to be fit and healthy. Women put themselves last after work and family. I've learned that if you don't make time for yourself, you'll get sick.

 Mary McKenna  /   Fidelma McGuirk is the CEO of the tax recovery service Taxback.com, which started in Dublin in 1996. She has also been a lead entrepreneur for Going For Growth. When I had my first child, I stopped working the day before I went in to have the baby, and I took four months off on my first and third (three-and-a-half months on my second). Happily, I have a great management team. I would meet key individuals and have the baby in tow. My baby came to plenty of board meetings – if people want you there, they can have the baby too. There's not yet a strong tradition of stay-at-home dads here. These days, being a stay-at-home mum is a bit of a luxury. It's brilliant if it can happen for a family, but for a woman it can lead to a stop in one's life. Your appetite for risk changes when you have a family.

 Fidelma McGuirk, chief executive of Taxback.com  /   Colette Twomey is the co-founder of the Cork-based Clonakilty Black Pudding Company (Clonakiltyblack pudding.ie), which she founded with her late husband Edward. When we started out, I was more behind the scenes. Taking the reins in 2005 when my husband died was the scariest situation ever. I knew everything about making black pudding and nothing to do with business. The meat business is male-dominated and there was that perception, "Oh, it's you that's running the business now?" But a lot of that is in women's heads; the idea that people are looking at us differently. You have to get over it. You see some women in the smallest businesses – two or three of them running a cleaning business – but they wouldn't dream of thinking of themselves behind a desk and running a big business. If people don't think big, they don't get big.

 Colette Twomey  / Denise O'Connor is the founder and the MD of Optimise Design (Optimise-design.com), an architecture and interior design company in Dublin. I think for a lot of women who have children, coming back into the workplace can be daunting and challenging. Men don't take those breaks, so the momentum in their career is there. With women, their confidence seems to go. That said, we're an incredibly lucky generation right now. A generation before, it was, "be a teacher or a nurse and then get married", or even just "get married". It's an exciting time for women to be in business because we can try anything. When I had my child, someone gave me a Gina Ford book and it was a bit like Barbara Woodhouse for babies; all rigorous routines. I realised you can put a huge amount of pressure on yourself trying to emulate everyone else. I was talking to my neighbour, who is in her 70s, and she said that when her children were small, everyone in the neighbourhood minded them. There was this amazing network of mothers that all chipped in. Unfortunately, that just doesn't happen now. My parents are fantastic, but you do feel guilty relying on them. It's definitely an area we as women could look into in a wider sense.

 Denise O'Connor  / Aisling Maher is the MD of Aisling Maher Designs (Aislingmaher.com), an accessories company in Limerick. One of my big role models, aside from my parents, would be (fashion designer) Orla Kiely – she created her own niche in an industry that's so cut-throat. At the very beginning, running a business is isolating, and it was difficult to get started. But it's so rewarding working for yourself because every battle you win is an achievement. Sometimes the balance between work and life can be difficult to achieve. I don't have children, so I can work late through evenings and weekends and I don't really mind. The business takes over my life from time to time, especially as my busy period is April to October. But I try to do an awful lot of yoga to get that balance between life and the business right. Female entrepreneurs who are interested in applying for the next Going for Growth programme can access information and register their interest at Goingforgrowth.com. The deadline for applying for the next programme is midnight on Monday, January 27th.
