 Susan Whelan CEO of Leicester City at WXN Leadership Summit at the Intercontinental Hotel in Dublin. / A senior executive of two market-leading companies in entirely different fields, based on opposite sides of the world, Dubliner Susan Whelan has successfully translated the commercial principles of luxury retail to the notoriously impulsive world of professional sport. Holder of a dual role at current English Premier League champions Leicester City FC and Thai duty free operator King Power, the club’s parent company, Susan has played a key part in delivering success to two businesses owned by the Srivaddhanaprabha family, to whom she has become a long-time and trusted aide. Susan’s 20 years’ of experience in the duty-free industry includes a 17-year association with King Power, whom she joined in 1999 and with whom she has held the position of senior executive vice president since November 2010. She has specific responsibility for King Power’s purchasing and merchandising functions, and commercial development strategy for King Powers’ retail outlets. A recognised authority and regular guest speaker to the global industry, her career has included senior management appointments in locations from Russia and Pakistan, to China, the Middle East and Thailand. She joined the City board as a representative of King Power following the Thai company’s takeover of the club in August 2010. Susan became Leicester City’s ceo in July 2011. Her experience and business acumen made her the ideal candidate to lead the execution of the owners’ long-term vision for a competitive club that could develop its brand internationally. Promotion to the Premier League followed in May 2014, providing a global stage from which the club would continue to build its profile. After the most remarkable escape from possible relegation the Premier League has ever seen, in 2014/15, Leicester City turned to new on-pitch leadership in the shape of Claudio Ranieri — a man whose appointment as manager famously prompted Susan to appeal to the club’s supporters to trust in the board’s judgement. Ten months later, Ranieri held the Premier League trophy aloft after City had defied pre-season odds of 5000/1 to win the first top-flight title in the club’s 132-year history — a story that transcended football, even sport, to capture the imaginations of billions around the world. This category recognises three women who own and run some of Ireland’s largest independent companies. Nominees must actively manage the daily affairs and own at least 20pc of the shares of the company if it is private or at least 5pc of the shares of a publicly-traded company.
