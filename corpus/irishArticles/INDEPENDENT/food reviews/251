Whether it's a lie-down on white sands listening to the sound of lapping waves, a passage to India or biking the greenway, Andrea Smith and Emily Hourican pick some of the fab-best holidays for the year ahead... Majorca  The biggest of Spain's Balearic Islands ticks a lot of boxes: short flight times, reliable weather, an abundance of child-friendly beaches, and picture-postcard scenery, including the Serra de Tramuntana mountains, and dramatic cliffs. Take a trip to the Caves of Drach, extending to a depth of 25m and around 4km in length, featuring one of the world's largest underground lakes. There are hotel resorts of shapes and sizes. Try TUI.  Brittany Ferries  Take the hassle of air travel out of your holiday. The luxurious Pont-Aven ship offers the fastest direct ferry crossing from Ireland to France, taking just 14 hours. Choose from a broad range of great-value accommodation (ferry-inclusive), across some of the most beautiful parts of France. Niyama Private Islands, Maldives  OK, this is a splash-out family holiday, but these islands are pretty unbeatable for once-in-a-lifetime getaways. Two in particular, Play and Chill, offer white sands, gorgeous villas and activities including a kids' club, splash park, wildlife safaris, underwater exploration with the resort's marine biologist, private snorkelling tours, dolphin-scouting and gourmet cooking classes. There is also a glorious spa, plus yoga, jet-skis and catamarans.   Arizona  For hardy kids who enjoy walking, hiking and exploring, the glorious mountains and desert lands of the Grand Canyon State offer superlative star-gazing, along with cactus-counting, reptile-spotting and ranch handling. Flagstaff was the training site for the Apollo 11 astronauts, and you can visit the Lunar Legacy attractions.

The Open Restaurants Festival, usually in November, is a fantastic opportunity to dip in and out of many restaurants and bars.

 The Gaslamp District, San Diego Courtesy JohnBahu / San Diego, California, USA  A vibrant mix of communities makes up the eclectic neighbourhoods of San Diego, from the buzzing bars of the Gaslamp Quarter to the glittering Pacific Beach and hipster haven of North Park, and there is a wide variety of excellent Mexican and 'Cali-Baja' restaurants. Try Puesto at the Headquarters in Seaport Village, serving the finest fish tacos, or Tahona in Old Town, offering a vast mezcal selection, while the city is home to 140 craft breweries.  Hachinohe, Japan  Forget sport, the best reason to travel to Japan in 2020 is food. Head for Hachinohe, in the southeast of the Aomori Prefecture, alongside the Pacific Ocean. In the city of Hachinohe itself, try amazing squid dishes in the busy port. Then head for the town of Gonohe, home to Kuraishi beef, among the finest in Japan, with perfect marbling that means it almost melts on the tongue.  Amsterdam, Netherlands  The city of canals, coffee shops and red lights is also, increasingly, a city of food. Start with the markets: Foodhallen has the city's best street-food vendors, dishing up dim sum, grilled fish, pizzas, Indonesian rice bowls, tacos and more; the beautiful Food Department is home to a host of 'gastro-casual' bars and eateries. Then try Stork, a large, industrial seafood spot on the banks of the IJ, reached by a free ferry.

 The Maldives at sunset / Maldives  The 1,000-plus islands that make up the Maldives are heaven for honeymooners. Laze by a pool sipping tropical cocktails, walk hand-in-hand along picture-perfect beaches, or enjoy some serious activity adventure, thanks to the perfect surfing conditions. Stay at the Kuredu Island Resort, offering the Maldives' largest watersports centre. Or head for Naladhu Private Island, a boutique gem with private houses that offers private dining aboard a luxury yacht. Kick back, and be happy.  Tahiti  A remote paradise in the Pacific, Tahiti is densely lush and beautiful, framed by spectacular beaches. Get busy zip-lining, waterfall jumping, jet-surfing, cycling and canoeing, or explore local traditions of dance, cuisine, tattooing (which originated here over 2,000 years ago) and music. Watch sunsets from one of the traditional over-water bungalows or from the deck of a cruise boat.  Namibia  If you really want away from it all, here's where to go: Namibia has the second-lowest population density in the world; 80pc of it is uninhabited, home only to stunning terracotta desert landscapes, spectacular sand dunes, beautiful coastlines and rugged mountains. The safari experience is astonishing: Namibia is the last place on earth where black rhino roam free; it is home to rare desert-dwelling elephants, and has the largest free-roaming population of cheetahs in the world.  Marrakesh, Morocco  Step into a world of colour, light, and intensely romantic tradition. Marrakesh is where to go if you are the wandering, take-it-as-it-comes kind, willing to go where the city leads. The main draw is the Medina, where you can shop for beautiful woven rugs, baskets, spices, jewellery, brass goods, leather and much more. Visit the Yves Saint Laurent museum, particularly the beautiful Jardin Majorelle.  Manali, Himachal Pradesh, India  Beyond the Taj Mahal and off the beaten track, India has a whole lot of love to offer. Consider Manali, high in the glorious Himalayas. This resort town is a favourite of Indian honeymooners, with its lush valleys and snow-topped mountains. It offers hiking, paragliding, rafting, mountaineering and skiing. Visit the sacred village of Vashisht, the Dhungri temple or Bhrigu lake. Or snuggle up in front of a roaring fire and admire the astonishing natural beauty all around.  Krakow, Poland  Repeatedly voted Europe's best city break, Krakow, a delightful mix of Gothic and Renaissance buildings, is plenty busy enough to keep you moving, but not so packed that you will feel swamped by all you want to do. Getting round by foot is easy and advisable: start in the 13th-Century market square. Try modern Polish cuisine at Art and, time permitting, a walk through the foothills of the Tatra Mountains, two hours south.  Coimbra, Portugal  The former capital (from 1131 to 1255) is a riot of architectural and cultural styles, including magnificent structures dating back to the Roman era, overlaid with lavish buildings from the Middle Ages when the city evolved into a major cultural centre. This is a university town, with lively nightlife to match. Head for restaurant Loggia, with spectacular views across the old town, while Tapas Na Costas has fine Portuguese wines and gourmet tapas.

 Seattle / Seattle, Washington, USA  Seattle has had something of an aesthetic and cultural renaissance of late. The city centre is pleasantly compact and walkable, and now fairly car-free. Check out the museum of Pop Culture, and Chihuly Garden, showcasing the astonishing studio glass of Dale Chihuly.

You're only a two-hour drive to Mount Rainier National Park, the Olympic National Park and the San Juan Islands.  Naples, Italy  Naples fell from grace as a holiday spot for years (deemed dirty and dangerous), but is newly resurgent, thanks to better rubbish collection and traffic restrictions. Check out the Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Napoli, or shop at Galleria Umberto I. Plan ahead and take in the glories of Pompeii, half an hour away - the central baths finally opened to visitors for the first time in November.  Tuscany, Italy  A joy that never gets old, this fabulously diverse region does charming cities and towns, stunning coast and beautiful countryside. Get off the well-worn track: once you are done exploring the architectural delights of San Gimignano, Lucca and Monteriggioni, head for Gaiole in Chianti and the Castello di Spaltenna, once a 10th-Century monastery, whose modern luxuries include two swimming pools, a billiard table, sauna, tennis courts, fitness centre and amazing food.  Qasr Al Sarab Desert Resort by Anantara  The Rub'Al Khali is the world's largest uninterrupted sand desert: 650,000 sq km of flame-coloured dunes. This resort lies 90 minutes from Abu Dhabi - a sumptuous experience of private villas, personal pools, a Moroccan hammam and desert spa rituals. Take a drive into the desert at night to gaze at stars; go on a guided hike at sunrise or sunset; camel trek across dunes; or ride Arabian horses along winding trails.  Macau  Known for its casinos, Macau is starting to attract a new kind of high-end tourism. The former Portuguese colony has a unique east-meets-west cultural mix: Chinese temples stand next to classical architecture, and the cuisine is an intriguing jumble of influences.

Gran Canaria  Perfect as a low-key family destination, Gran Canaria, with its fragrant pine forests, soft sandy beaches and cloud-scraping mountains, also has a more luxurious side. Meloneras, a chic town on the island's south coast, teems with elegant bars, restaurants and boutiques. Try the Lopesan Baobab Resort: this African-themed hotel is all about the water, with seven pools, and sand dune beaches close by. It has two championship golf courses.

Campagne in the city and Lady Helen at Mount Juliet both offer Michelin-starred food, while Anocht and Foodworks are just two of the many buzzy, contemporary, creative offerings.  Culture  If you don't live in Dublin, now is the time to visit. And if you do, take a couple of days and play tourist.

Equally unmissable is the Seamus Heaney: Listen Now Again exhibition in the Bank of Ireland Cultural Centre on College Green.  Adventure  Bike or hike the Waterford Greenway, a 46km route along an old railway line, or the 42km from Westport to Achill that make up the Mayo Greenway. Follow the Shannon Blueway, a network of canals and rivers, by canoe, or along the tow-path. Or try kayaking and paddle-boarding at beauty spots along the coast. There are now night-time trips through flashes of bioluminescence, while you watch homeward-bound seals and sea birds.  Foodie  Belfast is having a culinary moment, with The Muddlers Club joining EIPIC and Ox in winning a Michelin star, while James St and Ora Restaurant are also attracting rave reviews. Temper the eating with some culture - check out Titanic Belfast; the Botanic Gardens; the science centre, W5 at Odyssey; and the restored SS Nomadic - the closest you'll get to stepping on board the Titanic.

New South Wales  The idea of staying in an Australian eco-cabin with a bit of star wattage is appealing, and there is one whose design was led by Oscar winner Matthew McConaughey.

A percentage of proceeds from the cabin are donated to the Foundation for National Parks & Wildlife.

 Louise McSharry / We took our first family holiday when my eldest son was 11 months old. We were really looking forward to it, naively presuming it would be an idyllic time spent playing in the pool as a family. It was horrendous. The pool was too cold for him. He woke at four every morning, it was pitch dark until 7.30 and even the town's supermarket didn't open until eight. We spent the whole holiday exhausted and snappy, watching other people's holidays and wondering if we'd ever have a relaxing holiday again. I don't think I've ever been so happy to get on a plane home. Needless to say, lessons were learned! Joseph O'Connor Author

 Author Joseph O’Connor / In the summer of 1985, I was technically a student at UCD, but in fact I was in Nicaragua, hanging around and writing the odd article for newspapers and magazines back at home. I found it a fascinating place, full of life, hope and colour. The Sandinista revolution had happened six years earlier and there was a sense that new things were happening in Central America. I stayed with a local family in the capital, Managua, who were kindness itself. From time to time they would say to me that it was important not let my tourist visa run out since a dim view would be taken by the police if that happened. I was sure they were exaggerating and I didn't pay much attention. On the day that the visa was due to expire, a Saturday, I ambled along to the local visa office, which was in the local police station, to find it was closed for a public holiday. I wasn't worried. Returning on the Monday morning, I explained in my smiling, broken Spanish what had happened. The sergeant couldn't have been nicer as he smiled back and nodded, filling in what seemed an immense amount of paperwork. After about an hour, a police car pulled up outside the door, sirens and lights going gangbusters. I assumed that some very major local criminal had been nicked. No, the kindly sergeant explained, taking me by the arm and leading me down the steps towards the car. I was being arrested for visa violation. And now, I'd be going to jail. I don't know if you've ever spent a day in jail in Nicaragua? It wasn't quite as bad as you might imagine. I wasn't tortured or mistreated in any way at all. To a man, the guards were lovely, and very interested in Ireland. But it was a jail. With cells. And bars on the windows. And something happens when a door closes and you're locked into a cell. It's not like Porridge. There's no Ronnie Barker. All day long I sweated, and a bit of the night. I kept trying to explain what had happened and they kept nodding and smiling and making it clear that no, they didn't blame me, not in any way at all, but that there were laws, and that was that, and I had been arrested for breaking them, then they'd close that hole in the door and go away, whistling. It was the longest day of my life and I hated every moment of it, the day I did stir in Nicaragua.

 Celine Byrne / My worst travel memory is from when I was doing a German tour with Jose Carreras. The first stop was Hamburg. I had checked in my luggage for the two-week tour, and it didn't arrive in Hamburg, so I only had my travel clothes for two days. The concert was on the third day, I was still hoping that my suitcase would make it, but it didn't arrive, so I had to go out and buy a new concert dress. It wasn't an easy thing to find, so there was the stress of that. The next city we went to was Frankfurt. The airline ended up sending the luggage to Hamburg. Somebody kindly went by train to get my suitcase. My best was when I was in Russia. I was there singing and my children came over to visit. We had an amazing time. I'd never been to Russia before. Little did I know that my father's cousin was living there. He saw a poster, wondered if he was related, and I got talking to him and it turned out we were. Deirdre Purcell Author

 Deirdre Purcell / The worst? In the 1980s, our family of four took a 'villa' for a week in Dunmore East. Unceasing rain, day and night, while the 'villa' proved to be a couple of damp, leaky rooms above the garage of a small house. The best? A six-week trip with my husband for which we pulled out all the stops: a transatlantic voyage on the newly launched Queen Mary 2, travelling from Southampton and six days later, coming into New York at dawn with the rising sun gradually gilding every skyscraper in Manhattan; attending The Producers on Broadway after dinner at Sardis, also hearing the Mormon Tabernacle Choir in a basketball arena in Boise. Then a mesmerising motorhome journey through the national parks of northwestern USA, via Utah, Idaho, Wyoming, Montana and Washington State. Yellowstone was wonderful but I'll never forget Glacier, the eagles, bighorn sheep or the grizzlies.

 Brendan Courtney / I started a travel show in 1999 called Wanderlust, because I wanted to travel more. I travelled all over the world. My job was to jump out of a bus, point at the Eiffel Tower, do a piece to camera and jump back into the bus. And that's how much I saw of everywhere I went. I went on to do four other series of travel. My worst experience was in Vietnam: we checked into our hotel and it had no window. Then there were rats running across the pipes; all sorts of madness. The best travel experience has been our annual trip to the Greek islands; this year was the third year we have gone. Every year we do a different set of islands and we backpack. We competitively under-pack: I only bring hand luggage. Two pairs of shorts, one pair of flip flops, and myself and Adam. And we have no plan: we fly to Athens, connect from there, and off we go. We have the most incredible time, end up in the weirdest places. We ended up in Ikaria, which is one of only five blue zones in the world, they are the areas in the world that have the highest incident of centenarians. It's unbelievable; people in their 90s come down every day and swim in the sea. Families are all very involved with older people; they're very much part of the community. And they live on hills, so they passively work out every day, and they all nap every day. It was a fascinating place to be. My mission is to now visit the other blue zones. Claudia Boyle Soprano

 Soprano Claudia Boyle / I went on a walking holiday with my husband. I'm the kind of person who when I go on a holiday I like to swim up to the bar in the pool. It took some convincing for me to go on a walking trip, but it was the best experience. It was a week in Provence. It was tough, very warm. But we have so many memories from that trip: out in nature, talking to each other. We walked about 22km every day and then stopped at little towns. Even in the humblest of places, the French love their food and they cooked it so well. I just lapped it up. I know it sounds really cheesy but there is nothing like being in nature. It's so good for the soul, good for everything. Our worst was when we were in America visiting friends, and for one day we went to Atlantic City. Not my thing. We stayed in a casino; it was like staying overnight in a shopping mall. We both said no, not for us. Holly White Vegan author and food writer

 Vegan author and model Holly White at the Merrion Hotel, Dublin. Photo: David Conachy / I feel I should be speaking about something glamorous or decadent but what sticks out in my mind is a recent trip to northern California. I was there to attend a retreat on mindful eating. Food is naturally a huge passion of mine but it goes much deeper than just cooking and eating and I wanted to find out more about the psychology of the emotional component of why, what and how we eat. The retreat was in Mount Madonna, which is 300 acres of wild Americana: think wood cabins, deer crossing on the way to breakfast, wild turkeys arguing in the bushes and infinite starry skies at night. On day two of the retreat we were requested to continue in silence. As terrifying as that might sound, it was bliss. Gone was the need to make idle chit-chat. In the silence surrounded by redwoods I felt deeply touched by seeing how perfectly nature works when left alone. It gave me a huge feeling of faith that we should never underestimate the power of Mother Nature. It really was the very best trip I've been on for my body, mind and spirit.

 Actor and comedian Bernard O'Shea. Photo: Mark Condren / Being stuck beside a lake for two weeks together resulted in an engagement ring being thrown at me, but let's begin at the beginning. During a holiday in Riva del Garda with my wife Lorna we met a couple who offered local walking tours and took us on a little hike up the old road of Garda. It was halfway up this mountain road that I found out that my wife was afraid of heights. A sharp tug at my shirt told me she wanted to head back to the town, but she suggested I go on. I told her not to be stupid: I'd head back with her. Then our conversation turned quickly into a to and fro of "No, I'll go back with you", "No, you go on!" until it escalated into a full-on row. Now, instead of just leaving it alone and letting her head back down the road, I did what I do best and made the situation a thousand times worse by trying to convince her she had nothing to be afraid of. "No, Bernard, I don't need you to help me, I just want you to go on ahead with them and I'll see you back in the hotel." "Don't be silly, Lorna. We're not even that high and there's a road underneath us." It went on like this until the couple walked back down to us. I told them, "Lorna is afraid of heights, so we're going back." The lady turned to Lorna and said, "It's OK. I used to suffer from your illness." "Ha! Your illness!" I roared laughing. "Your illness," I repeated. Then I looked up and an engagement ring was heading towards my retina and she stormed off, leaving me with two complete strangers, one of them holding an engagement ring, right on the side of a cliff in northern Italy.

 Lottie Ryan / My favourite holiday memories come from my annual family trip to Disney World. If you haven't been, you probably think we're mad. Grown adults going to Disney World every year? YES! It is incredible. I have so many wonderful memories with my parents, brothers and sisters through the years there, and every time we go back we reminisce. It's almost a rule in my family that no matter how busy we all are, we have to put the time aside to go away together every year for that quality time. I'm very proud that we're able to keep that tradition alive.  Mary Mitchell O'Connor Minister for Higher Education

 Mary Mitchell O'Connor. Picture: Mark Condren / I remember all of us piling into the back of our Volkswagen Beetle and hitting the road to Dublin. My Dad stayed on the farm and we travelled to Monkstown to holiday. During the visit we met up with my mum's aunts Betty and Madge, who lived in Dun Laoghaire. I loved that we were leaving home in the West of Ireland and it felt like we were going to the exotic east coast. The journey took hours and was all about devising back-of-the-car games, and trying not to fight. We spent every morning on the beach at Seapoint and Sandycove, swimming and building sandcastles. It never seemed to rain on those holidays. In the afternoon we would all walk into Dun Laoghaire. I remember sitting on the wall, with all my siblings, Teddy's ice cream in hand, watching the boats out at sea. It's brilliant that Teddy's is still trading today. On one of the days we would go into the city and walk from St Stephen's Green to the GPO. Dublin always felt so cosmopolitan and foreign. I loved our holidays spent between Monkstown and Dun Laoghaire, filled with innocent childhood memories. I feel it is serendipitous that I now serve the people of Dun Laoghaire constituency in Dail Eireann - a real honour. Stefanie Preissner Writer

 Stefanie Preissner / I've never been to France, yet my worst two trips have been to Paris. I have tried to go to Disneyland Paris twice and both times have ended up in hospital. The first time I was 15, going on a school tour. My mum put my complaints about stomach pain down to nerves but when I ended up in surgery as my friends flew over the English Channel she realised that appendicitis and a worry pain are not the same thing. I swore off France until 2016 when I booked another trip to Disneyland. This time I was due to fly in two days when my doctor discovered a discolouration on the sole of my foot that scared her and the following week I was on crutches with the offending growth removed and replaced by 12 nasty stitches. Maybe I'll try to go to France again. Third time lucky eh? I guess it depends on what lucky looks like - either I'll get there, or I'll die. Finghin Collins Pianist

 Finghin Collins. / Over the years I've travelled a lot. I've had some really, really good experiences and some minor catastrophes. Just the other day I was in Switzerland, back in my hotel room after the concert, reception and dinner. I was checking in to my flight back to Dublin the next morning and I realised I'd left my music bag with the passport in it in the church where I'd performed, which was now all locked up. I had to ring the organiser, who had to ring the local police who came to open it up. It was a happy ending, I got my passport back. I can be quite forgetful and leave things behind. But I generally get them back, which is good! I've just been to Russia; it was my first time in Moscow, I had a really wonderful time. It brought back a trip I made in the year 2000, when I was only 23: a week in St Petersburg in June, with my mum and my sister. It was a magical trip. I performed Rachmaninov, and Rachmaninov's son was at the concert. We had a really special, special time.
