Moves to charge VAT on food supplements have been delayed until November amid a political backlash and protests over the plans. A 23pc tax increase was due to come into effect on March 1, but the Revenue has confirmed that the rate will stay at 0pc for at least another eight months.  Revenue said the decision was taken in light of Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe setting out plans to examine the policy and legislative options for the taxation of food supplements. The issue was raised in the Dáil earlier in the day by Labour leader Brendan Howlin who said people were worried about what he claimed was the government’s refusal to alter the Revenue’s decision to change the VAT rate.  He said he would be handing in a petition with 60,000 signatures on the issue to Mr Donohoe. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said it was Revenue’s decision to make. Mr Howlin welcomed what he termed "the last minute row back" by Revenue and said: "Common sense has prevailed". In its statement Revenue said that Mr Donohoe this week wrote to its chairman Niall Cody outlining how - "independent of Revenue’s decisions on interpretation" - he is putting in place a policy review on the issue.  He also outlined plans for a public consultation process and plans to engage with Health Minister Simon Harris to get his views on the use of food supplements.  Revenue said that in support of Mr Donohoe’s proposed review process - and to allow time for the enactment of any legislative changes in Budget 2020 it will delay implementation of its new guidance on the VAT rate for food supplements until November 1.
