Yelp has launched a fun festival designed to showcase the Instagram skills of Dublin’s social media foodies. A new festival which aims to showcase the camera skills of Dublin’s amateur food photographers will kick off in Dublin on Sunday. Review website Yelp launched the search for an Irish food porn star and will host a number of free events throughout February to provide inspiration for potential snaps. Throughout the ‘Foodgasm’ themed month, Yelp users are encouraged to upload photographs of their food adventures to the website for the chance to see their work displayed in a gallery setting in Harcourt Street’s newest hotel The Dean. Festival goers can look forward to a number of free food events including a Nookie and Cookies evening which sees Mish Mash and Sex Siopa collaborate in an evening of sex workshops and scrumptious cakes on February 25.
