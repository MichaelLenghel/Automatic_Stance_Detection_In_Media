There's a reason why second-screening is so popular - there's nothing better than enjoying your favourite TV show alongside a community of equally-obsessed viewers. If you haven't tweeted about it, have you even seen it? However, rather than spending this evening thumbing through your Twitter feed for the Game of Thrones season 7 premiere tonight, why not watch it alongside other fans IRL at one of these pubs? They're screening the episode at 9pm with pints and food and games before and after.

 / Finally, it's not a pub, but for those in the know, there's a secret weekly Game of Thrones cinema club for superfans at a secret location with food and booze (you can even bring your own). The GOT - S7 Weekly Monday Cinema Group is a private Facebook group for the "weekly get together of like minded souls to view the latest Game of Thrones episodes on a cinema sized screen with a huge P.A. system." In order to join you must be invited by a member.  And you don't find out the exact location (in Dublin 1) until the day itself. "All we ask is that you keep the location off social media and your mouth shut whilst the episode is aired," say the organisers. Fair enough! Online Editors
