A Chinese restaurant and a hotel were rapped last month over food safety fears, it has been revealed. Closure orders were served on the Loughbawn Hotel in Killeshandra, Co Cavan and the Golden Beijing Restaurant, in Ballincurra, Co Cork. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) said management at the Loughbawn were told to shut down a partially covered-in alleyway running from the kitchen to the street amid fears it was a public health risk. In a separate order, food business Cavan Wholesale, on the Dublin Road, Cavan was told to improve its operations or face further action. Prof Alan Reilly, FSAI chief executive, urged food businesses to continuously review safety policies. "The FSAI provides an advice line where our team of experts can help a food business with any queries they may have regarding food safety practices," he said. "It is of the utmost importance that food businesses are educated on the fundamentals of food safety skills in preventing bacterial food contamination." Two prosecutions were also successfully carried out by health chiefs over food safety issues in Mr Dees Chinese Restaurant in Glanmire, Cork and Militti Take Away, on Fassaugh Avenue, Cabra, north Dublin.
