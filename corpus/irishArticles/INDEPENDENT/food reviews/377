FOOD and drink exports have risen to over ?7bn for the first time, Bord Bia announced yesterday. And the appetite for ever-more convenience foods is set to drive future growth. Convenience foods such as ready meals, microwaveable meats and pizza will continue to be the biggest growth area because of "relentless lifestyle and demographic changes", said Bord Bia Chief Executive Aidan Cotter. Those products which offer added health benefits are set to show particularly strong growth as a third of people attribute their health problems to poor diet, he said at Bord Bia's Export Review 2004/05. Overall the food and drink industry saw exports grow by 3pc despite adverse currency conditions However, exports of prepared foods showed the strongest increase (9pc) to a total value of ?1.59bn. This means they are now worth more than beef and are catching up with dairy exports. Increased demand for convenience foods has now reached even the meat industry, with chilled microwaveable meats coming on the market for the first time, Mr Cotter said. Sales of specialty foods such as farmhouse cheeses have also soared - although small in overall terms, these sales provide a "halo effect" by boosting the image of Ireland's general food industry, he said. Some 300 specialty Irish food companies have also had average growth of 13pc.
