Lots of places say they are family-friendly. Go beyond token teddy bears and crayons at dinner, however, and it's a different story.  Think of those 'family' rooms that sleep just four (at a squeeze).  Think of the 'interconnecting' set-ups that double your bill, the leisure centres that limit kids' pool time to a few hours a day, or the kids' clubs shoe-horned into old meeting rooms.  Catering well to families is a niche that few hotels, self-catering stays and campsites do consistently well - in part, because they need to attend to so many different types of guests.  So what makes the difference?  From on-site water parks and to thoughtful touches like age-appropriate books or sensory boxes for guests with autism, we've reached far and wide for family-friendly stays we'd be happy to recommend to our own, well, families.  I hope it helps your next break together. - Pól Ó Conghaile

 Kilmokea Country Manor, Co Wexford / Where: Campile, Co Wexford Why: Gorgeous country houses are all well and good, but sometimes you get the impression that kids aren't exactly welcome.

 Kardio Kids at Raheen Woods Hotel, Co Galway / Where: Athenry, Co Galway Why: It's always nice to find little surprises for the kids when you walk into your room. That's something this spot prides itself on - tell them when you're booking with kids, and you'll find little treats like selection boxes or Easter eggs when you arrive.

 Where: Rathdrum, Co Wicklow Why: When Center Parcs opened in Ireland, we wondered whether small businesses like this would feel the pain. We shouldn't have. Places like Hidden Valley, named Ireland's Favourite Small Stay at our 2019 Reader Travel Awards, survive and thrive due to hard work, incremental growth and a firm feel for what returning customers want. This year, the family-run site added a new aqua park (the seasonal Splash Valley, with 30 obstacles). It's already got kayaks, laser tag, fishing, soccer pitches, Christmas Santa experiences and an adventure playground - and a new lakehouse bumped up the food options, too. - PÓC Bonus Points: The campsite gets packed, but traffic is slowed to a crawl, making it safe for kids to roam about. Details: Camping from €40 per family. Day visitors, €20pp. Some activities cost extra. irelandholidaypark.com If you like this, try: Westport House has family pitches, an adventure park and... dungeons. westporthouse.ie

 Luxe bedrooms at Larchfield Estate / Where: Lisburn, Co Antrim Why: If you're looking for a place to get away with a few other families (or your own extended brood), here's a solid option. Twenty minutes from Belfast, Larchfield is a rambling country pile with a combination of ensuite rooms and pretty cottages (and a super-cool converted Swiss army truck called Myrtle which has underbed heating, a firepit and a sauna). Onsite activities include archery and wildlife walks, there are games like giant Jenga, a swing in an old beech tree, and there's a family-friendly pub just outside the estate wall, too. All that, plus... alpacas and donkeys! - NB Bonus Points: The Estate's luxury breakfast hamper comes with all kinds of local treats like granola, yoghurt, smoked salmon, homemade bread and eggs. Details: Family friendly cottages from £240stg sleeping four. larchfieldestate.co.uk If you like this, try: There are cute cottages and courtyard apartments at Blessingbourne, Co Tyrone, as well as world-class mountain bike trails; blessingbourne.com  


 Where: Ballymahon, Co Longford Why: Longford's 395-acre mega-resort is the new standard for self-catering family stays in Ireland. Lodges are excellent, from two-bed woodland basics to 'exclusive' pads with hot tubs and saunas (and can be dog-friendly). Accessibility is thought-through, the spa is enormous, there are over 100+ activities and the water park - sorry, 'Subtropical Swimming Paradise' - is world-class. That said, our recent review found variable food, a discombobulatingly early check-out time (10am) and a slap of bill shock when you start seeing those extras add up. - PÓC Bonus Points: The campus is car-free outside of changeover days. Bring your own bike (hire costs €35/€25.50) and kids can roam on a brilliant and safe network of paths. Details: Two-bed woodland lodges from €339 to €899 for four nights, depending on dates.

 Top of the Rock, Co Cork / Where: Drimoleague, West Cork Why: If you're a family of animal-lovers, here's a dream come true. Set on a working farm, there are furry friends aplenty, and you can get stuck in with the Farmhands programme.

 The family room at the Conrad / Where: Earlsfort Terrace, Dublin Why: First, let's manage expectations - there is no pool, leisure centre or kids' club. So why include this fancy five-star? Well, the Conrad has launched a new family room, and is pitching itself as a slick base for a five-star city stay. Kids get books on arrival, welcome treats include Lego-shaped fudge and a box of games like Scrabble and Jenga; there are 48" TVs, baby bathtubs and bottle warmers on request, and the Coburg restaurant does a three-course kids' menu for €12.

 The kids will love Cork: the clubhouse at Fota / Where: Fota Island, Co Cork Why: Some family-friendly hotels sacrifice a sense of style, but Fota Island Resort is a rare find that feels both child-friendly and chic. There's plenty for everyone to do on the 780-acre private island, whether you want to channel that inner Katniss with combat archery or practise your swing at the kids' golf academy. Walking trails, a pool, playground, good menu choices and a well-run kids' club complete the picture. Choose from luxurious hotel accommodation or self-catering lodges on the grounds. Hidden in the forest, Fota Island Adventure also offers outdoor challenges (at a fee) for everyone aged 7+. - JB & NB Bonus Points: A free guest shuttle takes guests to the nearby Fota Wildlife Park, and we love the ballet lessons held for kids on Saturday mornings.
