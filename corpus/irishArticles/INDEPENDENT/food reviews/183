Fans shared their tributes to the popular Paolo Tullio online last night after the recently-deceased food critic appeared on a re-run of RTE's 'Room To Improve'. The programme's architect Dermot Bannon visited the writer's Annamoe home as he helped design 'the perfect kitchen' for a former chef.  Paolo gave a tour of his Italian-styled kitchen, with large windows framing the surrounding views of the Wicklow hamlet.  He also showed off his self-styled outdoor pizza oven and Paolo, Dermot Bannon and the programme's 'couple in need' laughed and chatted as they tried cooking their own pizzas.  The popular critic and Michelin star-winning chef passed away on Friday after a short illness. Viewers of the show shared their own tributes to Paolo online during the show.  "Very sad seeing Paolo Tullio on Room To Improve tonight. Really lovely person," one wrote.  Another tweeted: "Awww Paolo Tullio showing his kitchen on Room To Improve. Catching up on RTE+1. He was so proud of his pizza hut and orchard." Another fan wrote: "Just watching Room To Improve. Great to see its the episode with Paolo Tullio, may he rest in peace." The funeral service for Paolo Tullio will be held in the Examination Hall on the historic campus of Triinity College at 3pm this Thursday.  Online Editors
