You either adore Donegal, or you haven't been... yet.  Even for firm fans, this sprawling county with spectacular views at every twist of the road always has something new to uncover - and those revelations go beyond the beguiling landscape or 1,134km of Wild Atlantic Way coastline. Right now, Donegal's food and drink scene is one of the hottest on this island. Many of the county's best gastronomic experiences have been local secrets, but word is finally out - thanks in part to an inspired calendar of events co-ordinated by Donegal Food Coast and the efforts of advocates like Sue Glackin, whose Donegal Food Tours connects the dispersed clusters of deliciousness. Every Saturday afternoon, Sue's 'Taste of the North' tour showcases Letterkenny's best before striking out to the wilds of Downings and stops like Kilmacrennan's picture- perfect cottage café, Coffee Time, where Branden Kern demonstrates traditional butter- making. On Fridays, a 'Taste of the South West' jaunt starts with creative tasters at Donegal town's The House Gastro Pub; while a group-friendly gin tour includes a sampling of Castle Grove Country House Strawberry Gin in their beautiful walled gardens. Alternatively, you could jump in a car and ferret out your own foodie favourites. Here are our 10 best Donegal food destinations to get your adventure started.

Close
 Harvey's Point - TripAdvisor's top hotel in Ireland for four years running.  / Why: How better to start the day than with Lough Eske views and a bespoke breakfast ordered directly from one of Harvey's Point's charming young chefs? Talented head chef Colin McKee leads a happy team, and their pride shows in everything from freshly carved honey-roasted bacon to the elegant afternoon tea and carefully considered dinner menu. Service is exemplary, under the inimitable Noel Cunningham. harveyspoint.com While you're there: Chefs Joe and Brenda O'Hora serve perfectly executed classics in Ballybofey's Benny & Co Coffee Bar & Restaurant. The pastries alone justify a visit, if not a light bite of chicken liver pâté on sourdough, or brill on the bone for supper. facebook.com/bennycoffeebar

Close
 Rathmullan House, Donegal / Why: The Wheeler family at the Blue Book's Rathmullan House Hotel do things differently, as fans of their Electric Picnic food truck can attest. On the shores of Lough Swilly, their offer extends from walled-garden produce and pristine Greencastle fish in their elegant Cook & Gardener restaurant, perhaps preceded by a gin cocktail in Batt's Bar, through to stone-baked seasonal pizzas and Kinnegar special brews at their Tap Room. rathmullanhouse.com While you're there: Enjoy pristine fish and chips at Belle's Kitchen, followed by a Scarpello & Co cinnamon swirl from 9ine Hostages Coffee Co's truck on Rathmullan Pier. facebook.com/Belleskitchen12; facebook.com/9HCoffee Why: Serving small plates like McBride's crab claws with dulse butter, Fisk is the stuff of holiday dreams: a whitewashed outhouse of the beloved spit-and-sawdust Harbour Bar repurposed by two talented chefs, with sweeping views of Sheephaven Bay, to boot. Nearby, the Grape & Grain wine bar boasts summer-season specials like Big Green Egg steak nights (tomahawk or cauliflower), while the lively Logues in Carrigart adds Goose & Gander Pizzeria to the eclectic mix. fiskseafoodbar.com While you're there: Swing by The Haven Smokehouse to pick up Declan McConnellogue's acclaimed turf-smoked salmon, before heading to The Olde Glen for a creamy pint or their limited-edition gin. thehavensmokehouse.com

 Foodie heaven: Pizza from Rusty Oven / Why: Brave the summertime crowds for one of the monthly Summer Live Jazz & Seafood nights at Arnold's Hotel - or hold out for the Dunfanaghy Food Festival, a roast goat feast at the foot of Errigal and the Donegal Dish countywide celebration (September 27- October 1). The impeccably conceived Breac.House retreat on Horn Head hosts autumn residencies from Donegal chef Ciaran Sweeney of Dublin's Forest & Marcy (September) or Tony Davidson and Lina Reppert of Fisk (October). See donegalfoodcoast.ie for all event details. While you're there: Don't miss The Rusty Oven for thin-crust pizzas or The Mill for well-sourced traditional cooking with unexpected twists like home-smoked olives.
