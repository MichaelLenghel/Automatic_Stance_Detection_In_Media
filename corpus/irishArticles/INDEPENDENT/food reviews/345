FOOD manufacturers have created a 'toxic' environment which inevitably makes children become overweight, according to major new research. It says high calorie, low fibre western diets are promoting hormonal imbalances in children which drive them to overeat. The claims are made by Robert Lustig, professor of paediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco. In a review of obesity research, he said western diets are causing children's bodies to over-produce insulin, creating an environment in which foods were "essentially addictive". Changes to food processing over the past 30 years, particularly the addition of sugar to foods that never previously included it, and the removal of fibre, both promoted insulin production. "Too much fructose and not enough fibre appear to be the cornerstones of the obesity epidemic through their effects on insulin," he said. The review is published in 'Nature Clinical Practice Endocrinology and Metabolism'. Figures show one child in five is overweight and cases of adult-onset Type 2 diabetes, linked with excess weight, are being seen in children for the first time. Prof Lustig said it had long been known that insulin acted on the brain to encourage eating by suppressing leptin, the hormone that signals fullness, and boosting the pleasurable dopamine rush that accompanies eating. Children could not be blamed for overeating when the foods they were offered were 'toxic' fast foods full of sugar and devoid of fibre, he said. "No child chooses to be obese. Young children are not responsible for food choices. It can hardly be said that pre-school children, in whom obesity is rampant, can be held responsible. "If we don't fix this our children will continue to lose," he added. (©Independent News Service).
