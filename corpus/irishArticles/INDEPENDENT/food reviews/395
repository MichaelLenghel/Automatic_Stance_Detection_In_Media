Recently our restaurants are receiving rave reviews in the national papers. If it's not La Dolce Vita, it's La Riva - they're all getting honurable mention. Meanwhile, if thats not food for thought, Wexford's great reputation for music is getting better and better. Chamber choir Valdo return from Verona with a gold medal - the 1st Irish choir ever to get 1st prize in the International competition. And on another note - another musical one at that, The Young Wexford Singers have performed on TG4's "An Tuath Nua". They're recording an educational CD which helps children learn Irish through music. It's a new project in which its an honour to be part of and the CD will be used in schools throughout Ireland. So if music be the "food of love", then come to Wexford and indulge. Ruth Murphy
