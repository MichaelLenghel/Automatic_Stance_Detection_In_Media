The European Commission has demanded an urgent review of processed foods imported from China after more than 53,000 infants in the country were poisoned and four died from drinking tainted milk. The European Union has an import ban on milk or dairy products from China because of long-standing concerns that Chinese procedures to pick up contamination from industrial residues are insufficient. Consumer safety regulators have demanded new checks and assurances on "composite'' food imports, such as Chinese cakes or biscuits, that might contain milk or diary products. The EU's Food Safety Authority is due to report back later this week. Contaminated A commission spokesman said: "We have asked the Chinese authorities to provide confirmation that products exported to the EU do not contain contaminated milk and to suspend exports if they do. We have asked member states and national authorities to strengthen controls and check on borders to include products that might contain milk.'' Dr Andrew Wadge, the chief scientist for Britain's Food Standards Agency, confirmed that an investigation had begun in Britain into "composite'' food products. He sought to reassure consumers that the main risk was to infants in China, "whose sole source of nutrition'' came from the contaminated milk. (©Daily Telegraph, London)
