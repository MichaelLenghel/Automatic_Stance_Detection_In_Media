The spice bag is good, too. 25 LEE KEE 110a Parnell Street, Dublin 1. (083) 450 0922 Chef Gaz Smith of Michael's in Mount Merrion calls it "the Parnell Street lottery", because the chefs in Dublin's Chinatown seem to move around a lot from one establishment to another, so consistency can be an issue. Lee Kee is one that holds its own, though, with authentic food that's a cut above your average Chinese. Jane Kupen, of the celebrated Luna restaurant on Drury Street, recommends the sea whelks and cumin lamb in particular. She says that the pig's ear salad is "interesting". 26 LUCKY TORTOISE Hill Pub, Ranelagh, Dublin 6. luckytortoise.co The Lucky Tortoise serves a dim sum brunch at the Hill pub in Ranelagh each Sunday from (and also at Eatyard beside the Bernard Shaw pub in Dublin 2).

(01) 679 2000, sabadublin.com One of the best known of Dublin's Asian restaurants, with a second branch on Baggot Street and now a takeaway operation also.
