Des Malone, Managing Director of Malones believes that it is the combination of using only 100% Irish free-range meats and real ingredients like whiskey from the Cooley Distillery in their whiskey salami and O’Hara’s Celtic stout in their stout cured beef that makes the difference “we are offering customers what they want - quality, hand made meats with real tastes” .  “It really comes home to you,” Des added, “when people like Fortnum and Masons and Harrods like your products and start to stock them, it is a real endorsement from two of the strongest players in the fine food sector.”  A family business in the truest sense, the Malone’s core management team comprises of two brothers and two sisters from Dundalk who are the fifth generation of the Malone family to work in the pork industry in this region.
