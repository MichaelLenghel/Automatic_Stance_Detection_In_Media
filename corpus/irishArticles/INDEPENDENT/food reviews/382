A man who is reputedly the first person to bring Asian street food to Ireland is to open a new street food business at the former Wren's Nest in Wexford town centre. Eddie Ong Chok Fong, who has restaurants in Cork and Limerick, and has been favourably reviewed by Tom Doorley and Lucinda O'Sullivan, is planning to open the new business early next month. The front of the street food takeaway will be in the former bar area, while Eddie plans to open a restaurant in the rear of the premises. The new Aroi street food business will be the third of its kind drawn to the town in the space of a few months and follows that of Wexford businessman Michael Hayes who is soon to open an Ramen Asian street food franchise at the former Chocolate premises near the Bullring and the late 2016 opening of Mi Asian street food, in Anne Street, which has rapidly become one of the most popular takeways in Wexford. Eddie said he started cooking street food in Thailand at the tender age of seven after moving there from Malaysia with his family. He is now a professional chef with time spent in Michelin-starred restaurants. Wexford People
