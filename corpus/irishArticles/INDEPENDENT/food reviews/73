A leading restaurant reviewer has plated up praise for Belfast’s buzzing food scene and labelled the city ‘passionate’ about restaurant culture. Jay Rayner, who is a resident critic and food writer for BBC and The Observer said that Belfast’s food culture has developed in leaps and bounds throughout the last four years. "Over the past three or four years, the thing that struck me is just how passionate people in Belfast are about their city's food scene. They are very interested in what outsiders think,” he said. "People in Belfast who are interested in food and restaurants are more even and open-handed than any I have come across." The critic was speaking ahead of his My Dining Hell show in the city’s Black Box theatre. In the past, Rayner has written many reviews slating eateries in Belfast, one which was particularly cruel. "It's not fair to name the restaurant again - it was four years ago after all," he said. "But then I came back again and reviewed James St South very positively, and also did a collective review of four new places - and people seemed rather taken by what I said." Rayner visited Belfast’s Zen, Coppi, The Mourne Seafood Bar and Ox, which he was particularly impressed by. "[Ox] simply wants to be best in class and then some. It wants to celebrate the best ingredients on its doorstep, and do it with unstudied professionalism. On those terms it has more than achieved its goals. It doesn't need to show off. “Ox knows it's the most interesting thing to happen to Belfast in a long while," he said. Belfast Telegraph
