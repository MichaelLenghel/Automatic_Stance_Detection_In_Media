IN its food/drink/horticulture export review, Bord Bia has announced an increase in exports to over ?7bn for the first time. Chief executive Aidan Cotter said the industry was facing "a defining period" with year-on-year growth for the Irish food and drink industry in the region of 3pc. Irish food, drink and horticulture exports experienced solid growth in 2004, with prepared foods, for example, resuming growth, by ?130m. The value of exports increased by 3pc to ?7.17bn with 90pc of our beef exports now going to Europe. The latest estimated gross output of the Irish agri-food and drink industry is valued at ?16.6bn, with Irish food and drink being exported to over 170 countries. There were, however, many challenges facing the industry in 2004. In addition to the appreciation of the euro against the US dollar and sterling, there was a more competitive trading environment shaped by retailer consolidation, retail food price deflation and product competition. The sectors that saw the most significant growth in terms of value of exports in 2004 were prepared foods, dairy products and ingredients and beef. 31pc of exports in 2004 were into the euro zone, 42pc were into the sterling area, with the rest of the world accounting for 27pc. Taking into account currency movements, the underlying growth in Irish exports last year was 5pc. Predictions for 2005 expect that the euro will continue to appreciate, leaving Irish food and drink companies facing yet another challenging year in the trading environment. Exports of meat and livestock made up the largest single sector at ?2.19bn. Increases in beef and sheepmeat totalling 22pc made up for the 21pc decline in livestock exports, while pigmeat exports increased in 2004 by 6pc to ?265m. The exportation of prepared foods increased by 9pc to a total value of ?1.59bn as sales to the British market along with Continental Europe increased. Dairy products and ingredients exports experienced a 6pc rise to almost ?1.86bn, a good response despite EU enlargement, the implementation of the Mid-Term Review, and cutbacks in production among the original 15 EU countries. Exports of horticulture dropped by 12pc to ?186m, a fall driven by export declines in the mushroom sector. Mr Cotter said the outlook for the Irish food and drink industry in 2005 is broadly positive. The beef sector can expect a widening of the EU beef deficit by approximately 350,000t. Areas to watch in the beef sector will be the increase in low-priced non-EU beef coming into Europe, particularly from South America, and a prospective return of the Over Thirty Month beef to the UK market. In the dairy sector, factors such as the weak US dollar and further implementation of the Mid-Term Review remain a challenge in 2005. In horticulture, the outlook for 2005 is that market conditions will remain challenging, as trends continue towards consolidation and higher productivity through greater scale at production level.
