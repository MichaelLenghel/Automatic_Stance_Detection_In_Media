The headline isn't mine - I stole it from Jess Murphy, the chef at Kai in Galway, a terrific restaurant that I reviewed on these pages a couple of weeks ago. Chefs have always known that butter is better than the alternatives, simply because it tastes better. Does anyone ever get excited about eating lovely floury Irish potatoes with a knob of low fat spread on top? No, thought not. There was a big kerfuffle a few months back when Time magazine ran a cover story entitled 'Eat Butter. Scientists labelled fat the enemy. Why they were wrong.' Everyone who had spent the last couple of decades smearing their morning toast with a blend of trans fats and lord knows what else felt aggrieved. And while almost no one is saying that butter is a health food and that we should all be trying to cram as much of it into our daily diet as we can (that message is reserved for leafy greens and oily fish), butter is definitely back - in moderation. Along with the sourdough bread for which it is such a perfect partner, many of the country's restaurants are now producing their own butter in-house: whipped, flavoured, cultured, and fermented are just some of the variations that you can expect to encounter. Happily, the grass-fed cows of Ireland have always led the way in producing delicious butter that visitors to Ireland enjoy so much but which we locals tend to take for granted. And while the big butter brands are familiar to us all, it is worth seeking out some of the smaller-production butters that are increasingly available. One of the best is Abernethy Butter, hand-churned in Down and to be found on the shelves of Fortnum & Mason in London, and on the tables of Michelin-starred restaurants across the UK. The dulse and smoked butters are particularly special and you'll find a list of stockists on abernethybuttercompany.com. Improper Butter is an Irish start-up set up by Elaine Lavery and Hannah O'Reilly just three years ago, which now has listings in SuperValu and Centra, and exports to the UK and UEA. The company has recently introduced a reduced salt butter using finely milled sea salt from Clogherhead in Louth to sit alongside its garlic and garlic and chilli butters. improperbutter.com Meanwhile, Cuinneog Butter is a fermented country butter produced in Mayo by the Butler family and is a favourite with many Irish chefs, including Ross Lewis of the Michelin-starred Chapter One. You'll find its distinctive orange packaging in retail outlets across the country. cuinneog.com You'll find other small production butters in speciality food stores and at your local farmers' market; give them a try.
